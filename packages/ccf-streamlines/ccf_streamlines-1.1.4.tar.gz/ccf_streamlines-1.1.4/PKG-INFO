# CCF streamlines

This package supports projection of Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)
mouse brain volumetric data and coordinate data on to 2D representations. It
also enables other operations that make use of the "streamlines" between
the top and bottom of the isocortex in the CCF.


## Level of support

This code is an important part of the internal Allen Institute code base and we are actively using and maintaining it. Issues are encouraged, but because this tool is so central to our mission pull requests might not be accepted if they conflict with our existing plans.
