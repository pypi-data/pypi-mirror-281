## Installation

Mac or Linux (inside `$HOME` or another directory of your choice)
```sh
python3 -m venv api-testing
source api-testing/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install api-testing-toolkit
```

Windows TBD

## Usage

This package is meant to be used with Jupyter Lab. Installing this package will also
install Jupyter Lab, so you only need to install the one package. You can either run
Jupyter via CLI with the venv activated or point the desktop version at the venv
(that's my recommendation).

The toolkit provides a few utility functions that can be ignored if you don't want to
use them. The important part is the pattern, not the details.
