# =========================
# Suggestion to assessments
# =========================
# The distribution of assessments over the course should be structured as follows:
# - Two exams, each accounting for 15% of the total grade, to assess understanding of digital representation of information, logical functions, architecture of a processor, arithmetic circuits, and memory system.
# - Weekly quizzes, contributing 5% each to the final grade, to evaluate knowledge on internal organization of a computer, study of a didactic architecture, sequential circuits, and input/output peripherals.
# - Bi-weekly individual assignments, worth 10% each, focused on practical applications and problem-solving related to the topics covered.

It should contain content and activities to support the achievement of learning objectives and should align with the [Assessments].
            Ensure that the [Teaching Methodologies] relate to <Syllabus Topics> reflects a learner-centred perspective, focusing on students needs and engagement. Emphasize methodologies that prepare students for professional practice since it is a polytechnical university. Specify how students can perform self-study and peer and group learning beyond the contact hours into 'Self Study' subtopic; specify wich digital technology applications that could be used by students in self study, using the brand names in parenthesis preceded by "e.g., "; relate the [Teaching Methodologies] to the [Intended Learning Outcomes] in paragraphs containing when suitable the "TM<number>: TM tipology (<ILO reference>)", don't forget it. Be coherent and not redundant. Check if the total of the hours distributed is {contactHours}, if not, redistribute the hours preserving the reasoning used. Don't quote the related ILOs.

            [Assessments]
            Develop a text about the 'Assessments' considering the following requirements: between types: exams, tests, quizzes, individual, group work, debates and others; select the ones most suitable for the <Module> and the <Syllabus Topics>; articulate your answer with the pedagogical model; based on the [Intended Learning Outcomes], distribute weight (percentage) to each Assessment type; Only to your reasoning; Group assessments must not exceed 40% of the Assessment total; Explain how the lecturer should distribute assessments over the <Module> focusing on students engagement; summarize your answer in a bullet list such as "A<number>: description (<weight>%)". Be inspired by the [Intended Learning Outcomes] and [Teaching Methodologies]. Don't quote the related ILOs.
            Your text must be less than 2500 characters: review and rewrite to optimize if need.

            [Final Write Exam]
            Determine if a final write exam is recommended or not and highlighting such as "Final Write Exam: Recommended or Not" (don't forget this instruction), considering the practical aspects of the <Module>, or if only continuous evaluation is suitable.

            [Evidence of Teaching Methodologies and assessments suggestions coherence with the ILO topics]
            Develop a text about the 'Evidence of all Teaching Methodologies and assessments coherence with the entire ILO topics', considering the following requirements: relate [Intended Learning Outcomes] to the respective [Teaching Methodologies] and [Assessments], display the answer in a summarized list, attach to your answer a summary using only letters and numbers, like that "ILO<topic numbers> -> TM<TM numbers>; A<Asessment numbers>". Based on the <Syllabus Topics>.

Fundamental references are that which cover all <Syllabus Topics>. Complmementary references are that which cover at least one <Syllabus Topic> already covered by any Fundamental reference. Include at least one relevant Portuguese book in <Module> area if it exists; Don't forget, display the bibliography in APA style and the author surnames in capital letters; searching in web the year and publisher of each books. Check if each book exists. A book exists if you find this book in E-commerce web site and find the respective Publisher. Don't suggest journal papers and websites.
            Your text must be less than 700 characters: review and optimize your answer to fit this target.

            [Syllabus in Bibliography]
            Show me a bullet list with which of these books in [Bibliography] each <Syllabus Topics> are found; cite book by bibliography numbering such as "B<number>" and syllabus topics by syllabus numbering such as "S<number>". If any <Syllabus Topics> is found exclusively in a complementary bibliography, then it should go to "Fundamental" category. If there aren't books in the "Complementary" category, then don't split [Bibliography] in categories.
            Your text must be less than 300 characters: review and optimize your answer to fit this target.

            Preparing for micro-credentials can include being directly awarded module completion certificates or digital badges if students succeed in class testing, preparing for other micro-credentials that students self-learn and can later apply to exams in the Polytechnic Institute, or achieving a step into a complete credential issued by that Tech player.
            Identify which <Syllabus Topics> can relate to preparing students for microcredentials, digital badges, training paths, and other similar digital competencies that Microsoft, Cisco, and Palo Alto can recognize.
            Your text must be less than 700 characters: review and optimize your answer to fit this target.

            [Final Check Rules]
            The following rules should only be considered at the end of your reasoning, make sure to apply them:

            1. Analyse and review the [Intend Learning Outcome] set to ensure clear learning objectives outlining specific skills, knowledge, and competencies students are expected to gain;
            2. Analyze the topics and concepts covered in the <Syllabus Topics>;
