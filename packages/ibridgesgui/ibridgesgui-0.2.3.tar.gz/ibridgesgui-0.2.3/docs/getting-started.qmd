Before we start iBridges for the first time let us check and create a valid configuration file; Click on `Configure -> Add Configuration`.

If you already stored an `irods_environment.json` in the directory `~/.irods` (Windows `C:\Users\<username>\.irods`) then you can use the drop-down menu (little downward arrow) to load the configuration.

If you do not have an iRODS configuration yet, click on the button `New Config`.

You should see now something like:

Click the `Check` button to find out whether you can make a connection to the iRODS server. If you get error messages, adjust the contents accordingly. If you are unsure, please contact your iRODS service provider.

Once the check runs through fine click the `Save` or `Save as` button. This will store the adjusted configuration in the correct directory on you laptop so that we can use it for the login (See Section below).

## Start an iRODS session

To start working with data in iRODS select `Connect -> Connect to iRODS`. This will open the pop-up window

Select the file we edited above from the drop-down menu and provide your password. If you already logged into iRODS with this or another iRODS client your password might still be cached. This is indicated by the `******`. Hit `<Enter>` or press the `Connect` button.
