Welcome to the iBridges documentation!
======================================

`iBridges <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges>`__ is a Python library to connect to iRods servers in a simplified and safe manner.

.. admonition:: Warning

   The project (including documentation) is currently in active development at a pre-alpha stage, which means that some functionality may be
   broken or not implemented yet. We appreciate help, issues and bug report in our issue tracker on `github <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges>`__.


iBridges is a wrapper around the `python-irodsclient <https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient>`__. While the
python-irodsclient is very powerful and feature rich, we aim to provide an easier API for users (mainly researchers)
that do not have any technical knowledge of iRods.

We provide extensive tutorials on how to work with data in iRODS. Please consult our `iBridges <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges/tree/main/tutorials>`__.
