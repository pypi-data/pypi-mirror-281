              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

# LLM Comparator: Python Library

The LLM Comparator Python Library provides a simple API for configuring and
running **comparative evaluations** of models, and generating the JSON files
required to analyze these models side-by-side in the
[LLM Comparator app][llm-comparator-app].

## Installation

```sh
# [OPTIONAL] We recommend using a Python virtual environemnt.
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/llm_comparator
source ~/.venv/llm_comparator/bin/activate
```

You can install this library from the PyPI registry. This workflow is
recommended for most usage.

```sh
pip install llm_comparator
```

Or by cloning the repo from GitHub and installing from source. This workflow is
recommended for contributors fixing bugs or adding new features to the library.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PAIR-code/llm-comparator.git
cd llm-comparator/python
pip install -e .
```

## Core Concepts

The primary entrypoint to the LLM Comparator Python Library is the
`llm_comparator.comparison` module. This module provides a `run()` function that
coordinates the three phases of comparative evaluation: judging, bulletizing,
and clustering. The library provides modules for each of these phases, as well
as wrappers for interacting with LLMs.

### Model Helpers

The `llm_comparator.model_helper` module is used to initialize API wrappers to
interface with LLMs. Broadly, we support two kinds of models: generation models,
which should be text-to-text language models, and embedding models.

We provide concrete two concrete implementations of wrappers that interact with
the [Google Vertex AI API][vertex-api]:

*   `VertexGenerationModelHelper` supports any
    [generative language model][model-garden-gen] available in the Model Garden.
    By default we use `gemini-pro`, but alternatives can be configured with the
    `model_name=` constructor parameter.
*   `VertexEmbeddingModelHelper` supports any
    [text embedding model][model-garden-emb] available in the Model Garden.
    By default we use `textembedding-gecko@003`, but alternatives can be
    configured with the `model_name=` constructor parameter.

Additional wrapper classes can be implemented by subclassing
`GenerationModelHelper` and `EmbeddingModelHelper` as necessary. We welcome
contributions of these classes to the library via
[Pull Requests][llm-comparator-prs].

### Judges

The "judge" is the model responsible for actually doing the comparison between
the two model responses.

This functionality is encapsulated in the `LLMJudgeRunner` from the
`llm_comparator.llm_judge_runner` module. It requires a generator model that
conforms to the `GenerationModelHelper` protocol in order to call an LLM to
generate their judgements of which of the two model responses is better for
every prompt.

We provide a default judge prompt in
`llm_comparator.llm_judge_runner.DEFAULT_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, and you can
use the `llm_judge_prompt_template=` parameter to provide a custom prompt that
may better suit your needs at initialization time. Prompts should require the
judge to phrase its responses in a simple XML format that includes the `verdict`
and an `explanation`, to enable downstream processing by the buletizer and
clusterer. Note that if you do provide a custom prompt, you can use the
`rating_to_score_map=` parameter to ensure judgement `verdict`s can be mapped to
numeric values.

```xml
<result>
  <explanation>YOUR EXPLANATION GOES HERE.</explanation>
  <verdict>A is slightly better</verdict>
</result>
```
The same judge is run multiple times during each comparative analysis to get a
diversity of ratings. This can be configured via the `num_repeats=` key of the
optional `judge_opts=` dictionary passed to `llm_comparator.comparison.run()`.
By default, we call the judge 6 times.

### Bulletizers

A "bulletizer" condenses the results provided by the judge into a set of bullets
to make them easier to understand and consume in the UI.

This functionality is encapsulated in the `RationaleBulletGenerator` from the
`llm_comparator.rationale_bullet_generator` module. It requires a generator
model that conforms to the `GenerationModelHelper` protocol in order to call an
LLM to generate the bulleted summaries.

The primary configuration is the `win_rate_threshold=` parameter, which can be
configured per-comparative evaluation run via the `bulletizer_opts=` dictionary
passed to `llm_comparator.comparison.run()`. By default, the threshold is set to
`0.25` based on the default scoring range of [-1.5, 1.5].

### Clusterers

A "clusterer" takes the bullets, embeds them, groups them into clusters based on
embedding similarity, and generates a label for those clusters.

This functionality is encapsulated in the `RationaleClusterGenerator` from the
`llm_comparator.rationale_cluster_generator` module. It requires a generator
model that conforms to the `GenerationModelHelper` protocol and an embedder that
conforms to the `EmbeddingModelHelper` protocol in order to call LLMs to
generate the clustered summary of rationale bullets.

The primary configuration is the `num_clusters=` parameter, which can be
configured per-comparative evaluation run via the `clusterer_opts=` dictionary
passed to `llm_comparator.comparison.run()`. By default, a clusterer creates 8
clusters from the bullets.

## Basic Usage

We have prepared a Python notebook that you can
[open in Google Colab][llm-comparator-colab] to follow along interactively. It
uses Google's Vertex AI APIs to call models, and requires you to
[authenticate][vertex-auth] in order to follow along.

The following pseudo-script is the minimal distillation of the notebook linked
above, without any AI platform-specific guidance.

```python
from llm_comparator import comparison
from llm_comparator import model_helper
from llm_comparator import llm_judge_runner
from llm_comparator import rationale_bullet_generator
from llm_comparator import rationale_cluster_generator

inputs = [
  # Provide your inputs here.
  # They must conform to llm_comparator.types.LLMJudgeInput
]

# Initialize the models-calling classes.
generator = # Initialize a model_helper.GenerationModelHelper() subclass
embedder = # Initialize a model_helper.EmbeddingModelHelper() subclass

# Initialize the instances that run work on the models.
judge = llm_judge_runner.LLMJudgeRunner(generator)
bulletizer = rationale_bullet_generator.RationaleBulletGenerator(generator)
clusterer = rationale_cluster_generator.RationaleClusterGenerator(
    generator, embedder
)

# Configure and run the comparative evaluation.
comparison_result = comparison.run(inputs, judge, bulletizer, clusterer)

# Write the results to a JSON file that can be loaded in
# https://pair-code.github.io/llm-comparator
file_path = "path/to/file.json"
comparison.write(comparison_result, file_path)
```
