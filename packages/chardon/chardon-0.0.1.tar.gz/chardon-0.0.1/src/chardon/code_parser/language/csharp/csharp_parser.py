    """
    C# Parser to extract Class and Functions from a File
    Note : this is a selective parser, it will only parse documented code
    Algorithm explanation :

    CSharp code is structured as

    /// Comment ...
    Declaration
    {

    eg.

    /// <summary>
    /// blabla
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// more blabla
    /// </remarks>
    [Attributes]
    [...]
    public class MyClass : InheritsFrom
    {

    We thus approach the parsing with a simple method of looking for ///,
    buffering all comment, and then buffering all char until a { is found.
    There is probably some way to fit { inside the [custom tag],
    i'm not sure yet but will start with this and address this issue later.
    All this stuff will be called Block
    We will call Comment the text inside ///
    We will call Declaration all the text between Comment and {

    When we find a class | struct, we will store all further
    caught block inside it except when the catch block's
    Declaration is another class or struct.
    This is a greedy approach and can lead to a lot of issues :
    if two class are in the same file, but one of them is not commented,
    all fields will be mistakenly associated to the first class
    Correctly counting opening and closing brackets,
    avoiding those in comments and string is out of scope yet.
    This issue will only occurs times to times,
    but user may have hard times understanding how fields can be properly parsed but
    mistakenly placed in another class.
    I will open an Issue on Github to keep track of it for latter,
    and meanwhile a message will be displayed when a class has been
    parsed in the file and the language read another 'class' somewhere else
