"""
This file handles file persistence of common objects used in pipeline. For example, dataset references
that specifies the files in a dataset can be stored as a file and read using the interfaces in this
file. Note that many file format is a directory containing a single file, which may seem that the directory
is unnecessary but this is to accommodate for the possible need to add more files to store information
about the object class' instance.
