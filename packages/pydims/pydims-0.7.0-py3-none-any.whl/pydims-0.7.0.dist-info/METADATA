# PyDims

## About

Python arrays with named dimension and physical units.

Our goal is to provide a library wrapping any array library that supports the [Python array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/), adding named dimensions as well as physical units.
This is an alternative to Xarray's `NamedArray`.
The two main differences are
1. NamedArray supports `attrs`, which we think add unnecessary complexity while suffering from [conceptual problems](https://scipp.github.io/development/adr/0016-do-not-support-attrs.html).
2. PyDims supports physical units via a `unit` attribute, which we consider central and tightly linked to the concept of an array.

## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install pydims
```
