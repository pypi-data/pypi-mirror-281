``careless`` is a command line utility for merging 
data from x-ray crystallography experiments. It 
can be used to simultaneously scale and merge integrated
reflection intensities from conventional, laue, 
and free-electron laser experiments. It uses approximate 
Bayesian inference and deep learning to estimate
merged structure factor amplitudes under a Wilson prior.
