![title](https://dipcoatimage-finitedepth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/index-1.png)

DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth is a simple and extensible Python package to analyze dip coating with finite immersion depth.

## Usage

Store analysis parameters in configuration file (YAML or JSON).

```
data1:
 type: CoatingImage
 referencePath: ref.png
 targetPath: target.png
 output:
     layerData: output/data.csv
data2:
   type: MyType
   my-parameters: ...
data3:
   ...
```

Pass the file to command:

```
$ finitedepth analyze config.yml
```

You can also define your own analysis type by [writing a plugin](https://dipcoatimage-finitedepth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin.html).

## Installation

DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth can be installed using `pip`.

```
$ pip install dipcoatimage-finitedepth
```

Optional dependencies are listed in [manual](https://dipcoatimage-finitedepth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation).

## Documentation

DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth is documented with [Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/).
The manual can be found on Read the Docs:

> https://dipcoatimage-finitedepth.readthedocs.io

If you want to build the document yourself, get the source code and install with `[doc]` dependency.
Then, go to `doc` directory and build the document:

```
$ pip install .[doc]
$ cd doc
$ make html
```

Document will be generated in `build/html` directory. Open `index.html` to see the central page.
