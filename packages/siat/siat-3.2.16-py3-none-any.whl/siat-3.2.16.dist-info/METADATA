*** How is siat version numbered? ***
siat version format: X.Y.Z
X is the major version number. 
If the major number X changes, it means a primary upgrade, usually there are some big changes in the architecure. However, user's habits will remain for most of the cases.

Y is the revision number. 
If the revision number Y changes, it usually indicates some new functions have been compiled into the package.

Z is the build number. 
A build number Z change usually reveals a new compilation over the package for the purpose of debug only.

*** When to upgrade siat? ***
If you have been using the existing copy very well, there is no need to follow up the newest version. However, if you do find
some bugs in using siat, most of the time it is a quick solution to upgrade siat as well as the dependent modules that siat relies on.

*** How to upgrade siat? ***
It is strongly recommended to use siat in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. In Jupyter, there is an easy way to directly upgrade siat and its relevent modules together in the following command:
upgrade_siat()

If Jupyter prompts that pip command not found during the upgrade, it usually means that you need tick the checkbox 
"Add Python to your path" or something like this during Anaconda installation. If you forget to tick the checkbox, you may need to remedy the situation case by case. In some of the situations, the following command may work in Anaconda Prompt, but not for all the cases:
python -m ensurepip

*** Are there detailed case studies on using siat? ***
YES, hundreds of video case studies in the author's channel (most in Chinese, some in English).
