v1.2.0
======

*(2024-06-07)*


Bug fixes
---------

- |project| no longer crashes when received EOF or when channel is not explicitly
  closed -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

  Previously, |project| crashed if ``channel.recv`` was called and ``libssh``
  returned ``SSH_EOF`` error. It also crashed on some special occasions where
  channel was not explicitly closed and the session object was garbage-collected
  first.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`576`.


Features
--------

- Started exposing the ``SSH_OPTIONS_PUBLICKEY_ACCEPTED_TYPES``
  and ``SSH_OPTIONS_HOSTKEYS`` options publicly
  -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`527`.

- The ``request_exec()`` method was added to the ``Channel`` class. It exposes an
  interface for calling the respective low-level C-API of the underlying
  ``libssh`` library -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

  Additionally, the following calls to ``libssh`` are now available in the same
  class: ``request_exec()``, ``send_eof()``, ``request_send_signal()`` and
  ``is_eof`` which is exposed as a :py:class:`property`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`576`.


Improved documentation
----------------------

- Fixed spelling of "Connect" in the ``Session.connect()``
  docstring -- by :user:`donnerhacke`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`474`.

- Added a tip to the :ref:`installation guide <Installing |project|>`
  on how to set compiler flags when installing from source
  -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`499`.

- Fixed the example of invoking remote commands by using
  ``Channel.exec_command()`` in snippets -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

  Its previously showcased version wasn't functional.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`576`.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- A flaw in the logic for copying the project directory into a
  temporary folder that led to infinite recursion when :envvar:`TMPDIR`
  was set to a project subdirectory path. This was happening in Fedora
  and its downstream due to the use of `pyproject-rpm-macros
  <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros>`__. It was
  only reproducible with ``pip wheel`` and was not affecting the
  ``pyproject-build`` users.

  -- by :user:`hroncok` and :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`89c9b3a`.

- From now on, the published distribution package artifacts
  for the new releases are signed via `Sigstore
  <https://sigstore.dev>`__ -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  This is happening as a part of the GitHub Actions CI/CD
  workflow automation and the signatures are uploaded to
  the corresponding GitHub Release pages.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`986988a`.

- The platform-specific macOS wheels are now built using the
  Python interpreter from https://python.org. They are tagged
  with ``macosx_10_9`` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`333`.

- The ``toml`` build time dependency has been replaced with
  ``tomli`` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  The ``tomli`` distribution is only pulled in under Python
  versions below 3.11. On 3.11 and higher, the standard
  library module :py:mod:`tomllib` is now used instead.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`501`.

- Started using the built-in ``setuptools-scm`` Git archive
  support under Python 3.7 and higher -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`502`.

- Added support for Python 3.12 -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  It is now both tested in the CI and is advertised through
  the Trove classifiers.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`532`.

- The ``Cython`` build time dependency now has the minimum
  version of 3.0 under Python 3.12 and higher
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  The previous versions of ``Cython`` are still able to build
  the project under older Python versions.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`540`.

- :pep:`660` is now enabled -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  Previously, due to restrictive :pep:`517` hook reimports,
  our in-tree build backend was losing :pep:`non-PEP 517 <517>`
  hooks implemented in newer versions of ``setuptools`` but not
  the earlier ones. This is now addressed by reexporting
  everything that ``setuptools`` exposes with a wildcard.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`541`.

- The ``setuptools-scm`` build dependency CI pin was updated to 8.1.0 â€”
  this version fixes a date parsing incompatibility introduced by Git 2.45.0
  (:gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1038 <pypa/setuptools_scm/issues/1038>`,
  :gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1039 <pypa/setuptools_scm/pull/1039>`)
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`601`.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- The :doc:`changelog` page for the tagged release builds on
  Read The Docs does not attempt showing the draft section
  anymore -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`852d259`.

- Adjusted the publishing workflow automation to pre-configure
  Git before attempting to create a tag when building a
  source distribution -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`f07296f`.

- The CI configuration for building the macOS platform-specific
  wheels switched to using ``cibuildwheel`` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`333`.

- The OS-level tox package was upgraded to v3.28.0 in the UBI9
  CI runtime -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`461`, :issue:`473`.

- Fixed spelling of "Connect" in the ``Session.connect()``
  docstring -- by :user:`donnerhacke`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`474`.

- The Packit CI access to the internet has been restored
  -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`507`.

- Started building ``manylinux_2_28`` base images for testing and
  packaging in the CI/CD infrastructure -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`533`.

- Switched back to using Cython's native plugin for measuring
  code coverage -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`538`.

- Added separate changelog fragment types for contributor-
  and downstream-facing patches -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  Their corresponding identifiers are ``contrib`` and ``packaging``
  respectively. They are meant to be used for more accurate
  classification, where one would resort to using ``misc`` otherwise.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`539`.

- :pep:`660` is now enabled -- :user:`webknjaz`.

  This effectively means that the ecosystem-native editable
  install mode started working properly.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`541`.

- The duplicated jobs matrices for building manylinux wheels
  now reside in a single GitHub Actions CI/CD reusable
  workflow definition.

  -- :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`559`.

- The duplicated jobs matrices of the text jobs now reside in
  a single GitHub Actions CI/CD reusable workflow definition.

  -- :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`560`.

- Fixed the location of release workflow in the
  :ref:`Release Guide` document -- by :user:`Qalthos`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`565`.

- The ``setuptools-scm`` build dependency CI pin was updated to 8.1.0 â€”
  this version fixes a date parsing incompatibility introduced by Git 2.45.0
  (:gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1039 <pypa/setuptools_scm/issues/1038>`,
  :gh:`pypa/setuptools_scm#1038 <pypa/setuptools_scm/pull/1039>`)
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`601`.

- The CI/CD configuration was fixed to allow publishing
  to PyPI and other targets disregarding the test stage
  outcome. This used to be a bug in the workflow definition
  that has now been fixed.

  -- by :user:`pbrezina` and :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`602`.

  so it now generates a dir-based URL layout for the website
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`
  (:issue:`127`)
- Enabled `sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel Sphinx extension
  <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/>`__ to automatically generate
