## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.3] - 2024-06-25

### Fixed

* The request session now have the new session arguments for redis cluster replica.

## [1.1.1-2] - 2024-06-13

### Removed

* Old session arguments related to layout management.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-06-03

### Added

* A command-line session which periodically requests file revisions according to request rules. A rule provides a set of target files, and an OID pattern: each revision matching this pattern will be requested for download towards the specified sites.  
One can specify a delay before restarting the requests with the session's command line argument `--delay` (in seconds, default is `180`). A lifetime limit can also be specified to exclude newer revisions with the argument `--lifetime-limit` (in seconds, default is `600`).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-05-15

### Added

* Actions to request file revisions at project, sequence and shot scopes given a revision OID pattern in the wildcard format.
