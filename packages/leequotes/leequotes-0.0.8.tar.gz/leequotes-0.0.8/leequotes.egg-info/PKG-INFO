# Create a virtual environment

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the package
pip install leequotes
```

# How to use

Here is a minimal example of how to use the package:

print(quote)
```


# How to update the package (for clients)

To update the package, run the following command:

```

# How to update the package (for maintainers)

Once the modification is developed : 
1. Increment the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Run `python -m build` to build the package
3. Delete the old builds in the `dist` folder (if any)
4. Run `twine upload dist/*`to upload the builds on PyPI

Notes : 
- Once uploaded, the package is immutable. If you need to make changes, you will need to increment the version again.
- To test the package locally, you can run `pip install dist/<the-local-build>.whl`
