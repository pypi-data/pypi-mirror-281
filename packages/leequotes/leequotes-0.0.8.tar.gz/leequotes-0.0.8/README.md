Once the modification is developed : 
1. Increment the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Run `python -m build` to build the package
3. Delete the old builds in the `dist` folder (if any)
4. Run `twine upload dist/*`to upload the builds on PyPI

Notes : 
- Once uploaded, the package is immutable. If you need to make changes, you will need to increment the version again.
- To test the package locally, you can run `pip install dist/<the-local-build>.whl`
