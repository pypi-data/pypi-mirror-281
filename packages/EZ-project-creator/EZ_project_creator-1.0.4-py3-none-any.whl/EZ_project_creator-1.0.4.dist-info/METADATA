# Project Creator

Project Creator is a tool to automate the creation of project structures, set up virtual environments, and install necessary packages.

## Features

- Supports creation of full stack website, full stack data science, and full stack app projects.
- Automatically sets up virtual environments.
- Installs base requirements and additional specified packages.
- Creates initial project structure with directories and files.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```sh
pip install EZ_project_creator
```

## Usage

Run the tool using the following command:

```sh

```

You will be prompted to enter the project location, name, type, and additional packages to install.

### Project Types

- `full_stack_website`: Sets up a Django-based website with front-end components.
- `full_stack_data_science`: Sets up a data science project with directories for raw data, notebooks, and models.
- `full_stack_app`: Sets up a full-stack application, supporting mobile and web components.
