# Some examples to demonstrate the usages

## example1: plot phonon spectrum generated by Phonopy

    The phonopy package provides a script phonopy-bandplot to plot phonon bands
    We here provide an alternative script with more flexible arguments to optimize plots

## example2: plot phonon spectrum generated by Quantum ESPRESSO

    Read the phonon output from QE and plot phonon bands

## example3: plot phonon spectrum generated by EPW

    Read the phonon output from EPW and plot phonon bands

## exmaple4: plot some electron-phonon-coupling related properties by EPW

    Read some binary files such as elphmat generated by EPW, for analysis

## example5: Use qe_lambda to calculate the superconducting Tc

    This example demonstrate how to calculate the phonon-mediated superconductivity transition temperature

    with electron-phonon-coupling constants calculated by Quantum ESPRESSO, PH module

    It can exclude imaginary modes and only counts real ones
