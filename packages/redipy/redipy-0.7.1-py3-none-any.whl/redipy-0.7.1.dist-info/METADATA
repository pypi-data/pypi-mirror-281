           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# RediPy

`redipy` is a Python library that provides a uniform interface to Redis-like
storage systems. It allows you to use the same Redis API with different backends
that implement the same functionality, such as:

- `redipy.memory`: A backend that runs inside the current process and stores
  data in memory using Python data structures.
- `redipy.redis`: A backend that connects to an actual Redis instance and
  delegates all operations to it.

This [medium article][medium] explores some of the rationale behind the library.

If you need certain functionality or found a bug, have a look at the
[contributing](#contributing) section.

## Installation<a id="installation"></a>
You can install `redipy` using pip:

```sh
pip install redipy
```

[🔝](#toc)

## Usage<a id="usage"></a>
To use `redipy`, you need to import the library and create a `redipy` client
object with the desired backend. For example:

```python
# Import the redipy library
import redipy

# Create a redipy client using the memory backend
r = redipy.Redis()

# Create a redipy client using the redis backend
r = redipy.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379)

# Or preferred
r = redipy.Redis(
    cfg={
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 6379,
        "passwd": "",
        # A prefix that gets added to every key.
        # Can be used to implement namespaces.
        "prefix": "",
    })

# You can specify the backend explicitly to ensure that the correct parameters
# are passed to the constructor
r = redipy.Redis(
    backend="redis",
    cfg={
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 6379,
        "passwd": "",
        "prefix": "",
    })
```

The `redipy` client object supports similar methods and attributes to the
official [Redis][redis] Python client library.
You can use them as you would normally do with `redis`. For example:

```python
# Set some values
r.set_value("foo", "bar")
r.set_value("baz", "qux")

# Get some values
r.get_value("foo")  # "bar"
r.get_value("baz")  # "qux"

# Push some values
r.lpush("mylist", "a", "b", "c")
r.rpush("mylist", "d")

# Pop values
r.lpop("mylist")  # "c"
r.rpop("mylist", 3)  # ["d", "a", "b"]
```

More examples can be found in the [examples folder][examples].

## Features<a id="features"></a>
The main features of `redipy` are:

- Flexibility: You can choose from different backends that suit your needs and
  preferences, without changing your code or learning new APIs.

- Adaptability: You can start your project small with the memory backend and
  only switch to a full Redis server once the application grows.

- Scripting: You can create backend independent Redis scripts without using Lua.
  Scripts are written using a symbolic API in python.

- Compatibility: You can use any Redis client or tool with any backend.

- Mockability: You can use redipy in tests that require Redis with the memory
  backend to easily mock the functionality without actually having to run a
  Redis server in the background. Also, this avoids issues that might occur
  when running tests in parallel with an actual Redis server.

- Performance: You can leverage the high performance of Redis or other backends
  that offer fast and scalable data storage and retrieval.

- Migration: You can easily migrate data between different backends, or use
  multiple backends simultaneously.

## Custom Scripts<a id="custom-scripts"></a>

Redis scripts can be defined via a symbolic API in python and can be executed
by any backend.

[🔝](#toc)

### Simple Example<a id="simple-example"></a>

Here, we are writing a filter function that drains a Redis list
and puts items into a "left" and a "right" list by comparing each items
numerical value with a given `cmp` value:

```python
import redipy

# set up script
ctx = redipy.script.FnContext()
# add argument
cmp = ctx.add_arg("cmp")
# add key arguments
inp = redipy.script.RedisList(ctx.add_key("inp"))
left = redipy.script.RedisList(ctx.add_key("left"))
right = redipy.script.RedisList(ctx.add_key("right"))

# add local variable which contains the current value pop'ed from the list
cur = ctx.add_local(inp.lpop())
# we consume "inp" until it is empty
loop = ctx.while_(cur.ne_(None))
# push the value to the list depending on whether it is smaller than `cmp`
b_then, b_else = loop.if_(redipy.script.ToNum(cur).lt_(cmp))
b_then.add(left.rpush(cur))
b_else.add(right.rpush(cur))
# pop next value and store in local variable
loop.add(cur.assign(inp.lpop()))
# the script doesn't return a value
ctx.set_return_value(None)

# make sure to build the script only once and reuse the filter_list function
filter_list = r.register_script(ctx)

r.rpush("mylist", "1", "3", "2", "4")
filter_list(
    keys={
        "inp": "mylist",
        "left": "small",
        "right": "big",
    },
    args={
        "cmp": 3,
    })

r.lpop("mylist", 4)  # []
r.lpop("small", 4)  # ["1", "2"]
r.lpop("big", 4)  # ["3", "4"]
```

### Advanced Example<a id="advanced-example"></a>

Here, we are implementing and object stack with fall-through lookup. Each frame
in the stack has its own fields. If the user tries to access a field that
doesn't exist in the current stack frame (and they are using `get_cascading`)
the accessor will recursively go down the stack until a value for the given
field is found (or the end of the stack is reached).

```python
from typing import cast
from redipy import RedisClientAPI
from redipy.script import (
    ExecFunction,
    FnContext,
    JSONType,
    RedisHash,
    RedisVar,
    Strs,
    ToIntStr,
    ToNum,
)

        res = self._pop_frame(

## Limitations<a id="limitations"></a>
The current limitations of `redipy` are:

- Some Redis commands are not supported yet: This is likely due to redundant
  functionality. For all other cases it will eventually be resolved.
  Check [this issue to see the status of redis functions][implemented].
- The API differs slightly: Most notably stored values are always strings
  (i.e., the bytes returned by Redis are decoded as utf-8).
- The semantic of Redis functions inside scripts has been altered to feel more
  natural coming from python: Redis functions inside Lua scripts often differ
  greatly from the documented behavior. For example, `LPOP` returns `false` for
  an empty list inside Lua (instead of `nil` or `cjson.null`). While `LPOP`
  returns `None` in the python API. The script API of `redipy` has been altered
  to match the python API more closely. As the user doesn't code in Lua directly
  the benefit of having a more consistent API outweighs the more complicated Lua
  code that needs to be generated in the backend.
- Scripts aim to use python semantics as best as possible: In Lua array indices
  start at 1. The script API uses a 0 based indexing system and transparently
  adjusts indices in the Lua backend. Other, similar changes are performed
  as well.
- Scripts use JSON to pass arguments and return values: The arguments to the
  script are passed as JSON bytes for the Lua backend. Keys are passed as is.
  The return value of the script is also converted into JSON when moving from
  Lua to python. Note, that the empty dictionary (`{}`) and the empty list
  (`[]`) are indistinguishable in Lua so `None` is returned instead of setting
  the return value to either of these.

Any contribution, even if it is just creating an issue for a bug,
is much appreciated.

### If You Find a Bug<a id="if-you-find-a-bug"></a>

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue to draw attention to it or give
a thumbsup if the issue already exists. This helps with prioritizing
implementation efforts. Even if you cannot solve the bug yourself,
investigating why it happens or creating a PR to add test cases helps a lot.
If you have a fix for a bug don't hesistate to open a PR.

### Missing Redis or Lua Functions<a id="missing-redis-or-lua-functions"></a>
If you encounter a missing Redis or Lua function please consider adding it
yourself (see the [implementing](#implementing-new-redis-functions) section).
Here also opening an issue or giving a thumbsup to existing issues helps
with prioritization.

However, if you need it only in your local setup
without API support or support for multiple backends, pipelines, etc. you can
use the raw underlying Redis connection via
`redipy.main.Redis.get_redis_runtime` and
`redipy.redis.conn.RedisConnection.get_connection` or make use of
the plug-in mechanism.

For the memory backend you can use
`redipy.memory.rt.LocalRuntime.add_redis_function_plugin` or
`redipy.memory.rt.LocalRuntime.add_general_function_plugin`. The methods need
a module that contains subclasses of `redipy.plugin.LocalRedisFunction` and
`redipy.plugin.LocalGeneralFunction` respectively. Once the new functions are
defined via loading the plugin they can be used in a `redipy.script.FnContext`
via `redipy.script.RedisFn` or `redipy.script.CallFn` respectively.

Note, that `redipy.script.RedisFn` and `redipy.script.CallFn` can always be
used in Redis backend scripts. However, calling functions this way will have
the native Lua behavior which can lead to surprising results. To patch those
up as well you can use `redipy.redis.lua.LuaBackend.add_redis_patch_plugin`,
`redipy.redis.lua.LuaBackend.add_general_patch_plugin`, and
`redipy.redis.lua.LuaBackend.add_helper_function_plugin` to add the subclasses
of `redipy.plugin.LuaRedisPatch`, `redipy.plugin.LuaRedisPatch`, and
`redipy.plugin.HelperFunction` respectively. Those functions then can also be
used with the `redipy.script.RedisFn` and `redipy.script.CallFn` commands.

Adding functions as described above is discouraged as it may lead to
inconsistent support of different backends and inconsistent behavior across
different backends.

### Implementing New Redis Functions<a id="implementing-new-redis-functions"></a>

The easiest way to contribute to `redipy` is to pick some Redis API functions
that have not (or not completely) been [implemented][implemented] in `redipy`
yet. It is also much appreciated if you just add test cases or the stubs in a
PR. For a full implementation follow these steps:

1. Add the signature of the function to `redipy.api.RedisAPI`. Adjust as
  necessary from the Redis spec to get a pythonic feel. Also, add the signature
  to `redipy.api.PipelineAPI` but with `None` as return value. Additionally,
  add the redirect to the backend in `redipy.main.Redis`.
2. Implement the function in `redipy.redis.conn.RedisConnection` and
  `redipy.redis.conn.PipelineConnection`. This should
  be straightforward as there are not too many changes expected. Don't forget
  to convert bytes into strings via `...decode("utf-8")` (there are various
  helper functions for this in `redipy.util`).
3. Add tests to `test/test_sanity.py` to determine the function's behavior in
  Lua (especially its edge cases).
4. If the Lua behavior needs to be changed to provide a better feel you can add
  a monkeypatch for the function call by either creating a class in
  `redipy.redis.rpatch` to directly change the returned expr for the execution
  graph or using a Lua helper function via adding a class to
  `redipy.redis.helpers` (you need to use a patch to use the helper in the
  right location).
5. Next, add and implement the functionality in
  `redipy.memory.state.Machine` and add the appropriate redirects in
  `redipy.memory.rt.LocalRuntime` and `redipy.memory.rt.LocalPipeline`.
6. To make the new function accessible in scripts from the memory backend add
  a class in `redipy.memory.rfun`.
7. Add the approriate class or method in the right `redipy.symbolic.r...py`
  file. If it is a new class / file add an import to `redipy.script`.
8. Add a new test in `test/test_api.py` to verify the new function works inside
  a script for all backends. You can run `make pytest FILE=test/test_api.py`
  to execute the test and `make coverage-report` to verify that the new code
  is executed.
9. Make sure `make lint-all` passes, as well as, all tests (`make pytest`)
  run without issue.
