Manual Seats
============

This is a plugin for `pretix`_.

Manually assign tickets to seats.

Development setup
-----------------

1. Make sure that you have a working `pretix development setup`_.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Activate the virtual environment you use for pretix development.
4. Execute ``python setup.py develop`` within this directory to register
   this application with pretix's plugin registry. If you have problems 
   with that, try ``pip install -e [path]`` from your pretix virtual environment.
5. Execute ``make`` within this directory to compile translations.
6. Restart your local pretix server. You can now use the plugin from
   this repository for your events by enabling it in the 'plugins' tab
   in the settings.

This plugin has CI set up to enforce a few code style rules. To check
locally, you need these packages installed:

.. code:: bash

   pip install flake8 isort black

To check your plugin for rule violations, run:

.. code:: bash

   black --check .
   isort -c .
   flake8 .

You can auto-fix some of these issues by running:

.. code:: bash

   isort .
   black .

To automatically check for these issues before you commit, you can run
``.install-hooks``.
