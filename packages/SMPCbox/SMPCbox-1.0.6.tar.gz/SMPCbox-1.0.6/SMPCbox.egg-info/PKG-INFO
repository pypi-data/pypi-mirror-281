SMPCbox is a framework which can be used to implement Secure Multi Party Computation (SMPC) protocols.
The idea behind the project is to provide a way to easily test protocols, visualise protocol execution
and gather statistics on protocol execution.
This framework is meant to help researchers and students to better understand SMPC protocols.
