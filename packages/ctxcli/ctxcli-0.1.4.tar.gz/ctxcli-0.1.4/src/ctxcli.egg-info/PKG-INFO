To add users to business units, use the following command::

	ctxcli business-unit add-users --file <file_path>
	
This command requires a CSV file that contains the necessary user information. The file can be placed in the “input” folder.
You can specify the path to this CSV file using the --file argument followed by the path to your file.
The CSV file should include two columns with headers:

    business_unit_id: The internal ID of the Business Unit to which you want to add users.
    username: The username of the user you want to add to the Business Unit.
    
The command will read each line of the CSV file and attempt to add the specified user to the corresponding Business Unit.

Orders
------

The `ctxcli order export` command allows you to export orders to an Excel file for a specified date range.

Usage
~~~~~

To export orders to an Excel file, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   ctxcli order export --start-date <start_date> --end-date <end_date> --output <file_path>

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

* `--start-date <start_date>`: The start date for the order export in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `--end-date <end_date>`: The end date for the order export in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `--output <file_path>`: The file path for the output Excel file. The file will be created if it does not exist.
