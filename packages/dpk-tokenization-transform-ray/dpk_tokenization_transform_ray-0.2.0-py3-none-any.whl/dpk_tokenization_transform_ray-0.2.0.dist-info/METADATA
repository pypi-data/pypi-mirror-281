# Tokenization Transform for Ray
Please see the set of
[transform project conventions](../../../README.md#transform-project-conventions)
for details on general project conventions, transform configuration,
testing and IDE set up.

## Summary 
This project wraps the [tokenization transform](../python) with a Ray runtime.

## Configuration and command line Options

Noop configuration and command line options are the same as for the base python transform. 

## Running

### Launched Command Line Options 
In addition to those available to the transform as defined in [here](../python/README.md),
the set of 
[ray launcher](../../../../data-processing-lib/doc/ray-launcher-options.md) are available.

### Running the samples
To run the samples, use the following `make` targets

* `run-cli-sample` - runs src/tokenization_transform_ray.py using command line args
* `run-local-sample` - runs src/tokenization_local_ray.py
* `run-s3-sample` - runs src/filter_s3_ray.py
    * Requires prior installation of minio, depending on your platform (e.g., from [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/macos/index.html)
     and [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html) 
     and invocation of `make minio-start` to load data into local minio for S3 access.

These targets will activate the virtual environment and set up any configuration needed.
Use the `-n` option of `make` to see the detail of what is done to run the sample.

For example, 
```shell
make run-cli-sample
...
```
Then 
```shell
ls output
```
To see results of the transform.
