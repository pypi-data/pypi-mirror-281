Introduction
============

``psp-validation`` package is a tool for running pair neuron simulations and extracting postsynaptic potential (PSP) amplitudes from the resulting voltage traces.

It relies on `SNAP <https://bluebrainsnap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ for querying GID pairs from a circuit, and `BlueCelluLab <https://bluecellulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for actually running pair simulations.
