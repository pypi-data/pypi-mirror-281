## Background

`itscalledsoccer` is a wrapper around the same API that powers the [American Soccer Analysis app](https://app.americansocceranalysis.com/). It enables Python users to programmatically retrieve advanced analytics for their favorite [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer), [NWSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Women%27s_Soccer_League), and [USL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Soccer_League) players and teams.

## Install

```sh
pip install itscalledsoccer
```

To install a development version, clone this repo and run the following command.

```sh
pip install --editable .
```

## Usage

```python
from itscalledsoccer.client import AmericanSoccerAnalysis

asa_client = AmericanSoccerAnalysis()
```

Any of the `get_*` methods can be used to retrieve the same data made available in the [American Soccer Analysis app](https://app.americansocceranalysis.com/). Partial matches or abbreviations are accepted for any player or team names. For most methods, arguments _must be named_. A few examples are below.

```python
# Get all players named "Andre"
asa_players = asa_client.get_players(names="Andre")
```
