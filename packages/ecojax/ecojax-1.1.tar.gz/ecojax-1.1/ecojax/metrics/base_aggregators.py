    """The base class for all aggregators of a certain measure over the lifespan of an agent.
    At age t, the metric represented by any instance of this class is an aggregation of the measures of the agent from age 0 to t.
    To do that, an aggregator apply the function aggregate() at each timestep, which updates the (sometimes necessary) internal state of the aggregator and return the aggregated measures.

    The measure that is given as input, as well as the are_alive and ages arrays, are the measures of the agents at the beginning of the timestep (or as a consequence of their action).
    They don't concern the newborn agents, which are not yet active.

    Rules:
        1: When the agent is not alive, it means the agent was dead at beginning of the timestep. The aggregator should
            consequently return NaN in most cases.
        2: When age==1, this can be considered as the first active timestep of the agent. This will be considered as the
            initialization of most aggregators.
        3: Otherwise, it means the agent was already active in the previous timestep. The aggregator should update the
            internal state of the aggregator and return the aggregated measures.
