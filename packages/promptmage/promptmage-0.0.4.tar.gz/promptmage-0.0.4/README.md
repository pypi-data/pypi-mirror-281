## About the Project

"PromptMage" is designed to offer an intuitive interface that simplifies the process of creating and managing LLM workflows as a self-hosted solution. It facilitates prompt testing and comparison, and it incorporates version control features to help users track the development of their prompts. Suitable for both small teams and large enterprises, "PromptMage" seeks to improve productivity and foster the practical use of LLM technology.

The approach with "PromptMage" is to provide a pragmatic solution that bridges the current gap in LLM workflow management. We aim to empower developers, researchers, and organizations by making LLM technology more accessible and manageable, thereby supporting the next wave of AI innovations.

## Philosophy
- Integrate the prompt playground into your workflow for fast iteration
- Prompts as first-class citizens with version control and collaboration features
- Manual and automatic testing and validation of prompts
- Easy sharing of results with domain experts and stakeholders
- build-in, automatically created API with fastAPI for easy integration and deployment
- Type-hint everything for automatic inference and validation magic
