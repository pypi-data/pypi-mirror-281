## For all arbitrarily limited buffers, pick 4x the current default.

## On the long run, this might be replaced with a more fine-grained feature set
## picking the minimum size of all the items, or even an option to generalize,
## but this provides an easy way to allow unconstrained systems to stomach
## larger sizes (especially for experimentation) without making sizes explode
## on embedded.
