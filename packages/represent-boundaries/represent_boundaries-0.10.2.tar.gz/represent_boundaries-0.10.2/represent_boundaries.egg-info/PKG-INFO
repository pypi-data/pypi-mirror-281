Represent Boundaries
====================

|PyPI version| |Build Status| |Coverage Status|

Represent Boundaries is a web API to geographic areas, like electoral
districts. It allows you to easily find the areas that cover your users'
locations to display location-based information, like profiles of
electoral candidates.

It's a Django app that's easy to integrate into an existing project or
to deploy on its own. It uses a simple file format to control how data
is loaded into the API, and it provides a command-line tool to easily
manage data.

Notable uses include:

-  `Represent <https://represent.opennorth.ca/>`__ helps people find the
   elected officials and electoral districts for any Canadian address or
   postal code, at any level of government.
-  `OpenStates.org <http://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/>`__
   allows anyone to discover more about lawmaking in their state and
   uses Represent Boundaries to help them find their state legislators.
-  `GovTrack.us <https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members>`__ helps
   track the activities of the United States Congress and uses Represent
   Boundaries to help people find their members of Congress.
-  `ANCFinder.org <http://ancfinder.org/>`__ helps Washington, DC
   residents discover and participate in their Advisory Neighborhood
   Commissions.
