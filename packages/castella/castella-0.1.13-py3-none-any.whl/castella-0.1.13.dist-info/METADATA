## Goals

The primary final goal of Castella is to provide features for Python programmers easy to create a GUI application for several OS platforms and web browsers in a single most same code as possible as. The second goal is to provide a UI framework that Python programmers can easily understand, modify, and extend as needed.
(Stated on May 25, 2022: This goal is the final goal. Currently this framework is in the super early stage, so this goal is far away. I hope to get much closer to the goal in a few months or a year by improving the implementation or documentation a little bit every day as much as possible.)

## Features
- The core part as a UI framework of Castella is written in only Python. It's not a wrapper for existing something written in other programing languages.
- Castella allows human to define UI declaratively in Python.
- Castella provides hot-reloading or hot-restarting on development.
- Dark mode is supported. If the runtime environment is in dark mode, Castella app's UI appearance will automatically be styled in dark mode.
- Castella utilizes GPU via dependent libraries.

## Dependencies
- For desktop platforms, Castella is standing on existing excellent python bindings for window management library (GLFW or SDL2) and 2D graphics library (Skia).
- For web browsers, Castella is standing on awesome Pyodide/PyScript and CanvasKit (Wasm version of Skia).

## Installation
https://i2y.github.io/castella/getting-started/

## An example of code using Castella

```python
from castella import App, Button, Column, Component, Row, State, Text
from castella.frame import Frame


class Counter(Component):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self._count = State(0)

    def view(self):
        return Column(
            Text(self._count),
            Row(
                Button("Up", font_size=50).on_click(self.up),
                Button("Down", font_size=50).on_click(self.down),
            ),
        )

    def up(self, _):
        self._count += 1

    def down(self, _):
        self._count -= 1


App(Frame("Counter", 800, 600), Counter()).run()
```

You can see some other examples in [examples](examples) directory.

## Supported Platforms
Currently, Castella theoretically should support not-too-old versions of the following platforms.

- Windows 10/11
- Mac OS X
- Linux
- Web browsers
