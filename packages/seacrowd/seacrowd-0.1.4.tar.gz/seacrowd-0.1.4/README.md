Southeast Asia is home to more than 1,000 native languages. Nevertheless, Southeast Asian NLP, vision-language, and speech processing is underrepresented in the research community, and one of the reasons is the lack of access to public datasets ([Aji et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.500/)). To address this issue, we initiate **SEACrowd**, a joint collaboration to collect NLP datasets for Southeast Asian languages. Help us collect and centralize Southeast Asian datasets, and be a co-author of our upcoming paper.
