pypreql is an experimental implementation of the [PreQL/Trilogy] (prequel trilogy) language, a extension of SQL that replaces tables/joins with a lightweight semantic binding layer.

PreQL/Trilogy looks like SQL, but simpler. It's a modern SQL refresh targeted at SQL lovers who want reusability and simplicity with the power and iteratability of SQL. It compiles to SQL - making it easy to debug or integrate into existing workflows - and can be run against any supported SQL backend.  

> [!TIP]
> To get an overview of the language and run interactive examples, head to the [documentation](https://preqldata.dev/).

Installation: `pip install pypreql`

`pypreql` can be run locally to parse and execute preql [.preql] models using the `trilogy` CLI tool, or can be run in python by importing the `preql` package.

You can read more about the project [here](https://preqldata.dev/) and try out an interactive demo on the page an interactive demo [here](https://preqldata.dev/demo). 

PreQL:
```sql
SELECT
    name,
    count(name) as name_count
WHERE 
    name='Elvis'
ORDER BY
    name_count desc
LIMIT 10;
```
## Goals
vs SQL, the goals are:

Preserve:
- Correctness
- Accessibility

Enhance:
- Simplicity
- Understandability
- Refactoring/mantainability
- Reusability

Maintain:
- Acceptable performance

## Hello World

Save the following code in a file named `hello.preql`

```python
key sentence_id int;
property sentence_id.word_one string; # comments after a definition 
property sentence_id.word_two string; # are syntactic sugar for adding
property sentence_id.word_three string; # a description to it

# comments in other places are just comments

# define our datasources as queries in duckdb
datasource word_one(
    sentence: sentence_id,
    word:word_one
)
grain(sentence_id)
query '''
select 1 as sentence, 'Hello' as word
union all
select 2, 'Bonjour'
''';

datasource word_two(
    sentence: sentence_id,
    word:word_two
)
grain(sentence_id)
query '''
select 1 as sentence, 'World' as word
union all
select 2 as sentence, 'World'
''';

datasource word_three(
    sentence: sentence_id,
    word:word_three
)
grain(sentence_id)
query '''
select 1 as sentence, '!' as word
union all
select 2 as sentence, '!'
''';

# an actual select statement
# joins are automatically resolved between the 3 sources
with sentences as
select sentence_id, word_one || ' ' || word_two ||  word_three as text;

SELECT
    --sentences.sentence_id,
    sentences.text
WHERE 
    sentences.sentence_id = 1
;

SELECT
    --sentences.sentence_id,
    sentences.text
WHERE 
    sentences.sentence_id = 2
;
# semicolon termination for all statements

```

Run the following from the directory the file is in.

```bash
trilogy run hello.preql duckdb
```

## Backends

The current PreQL implementation supports these backends:

- Bigquery
- SQL Server
- DuckDB
- Snowflake

## Basic Example - Python

Preql can be run directly in python.

A bigquery example, similar to bigquery [the quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/query-public-dataset-console)

```python


from preql import Dialects, Environment

environment = Environment()

environment.parse('''

key name string;
key gender string;
key state string;
key year int;
key yearly_name_count int; int;


datasource usa_names(
    name:name,
    number:yearly_name_count,
    year:year,
    gender:gender,
    state:state
)
address bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013;

'''
)
executor = Dialects.BIGQUERY.default_executor(environment=environment)

results = executor.execute_text(
'''SELECT
    name,
    sum(yearly_name_count) -> name_count 
WHERE
    name = 'Elvis'
ORDER BY
    name_count desc
LIMIT 10;
'''

)
# multiple queries can result from one text batch
for row in results:
    # get results for first query
    answers = row.fetchall()
    for x in answers:
        print(x)
```


## Basic Example - CLI

Preql can be run through a CLI tool, 'trilogy'.

After installing preql, you can run the trilogy CLI with two required positional arguments; the first the path to a file or a direct command,
and second the dialect to run.

`trilogy run <cmd or path to preql file> <dialect>`

To pass arguments to a backend, append additional --<option> flags after specifying the dialect.

Example:
`trilogy run key in int; datasource test_source ( i:in) grain(in) address test; select in;" duckdb --path <path/to/duckdb>`

### Bigquery Args
N/A, only supports default auth. In python you can pass in a custom client.
<TODO> support arbitrary cred paths. 

### DuckDB Args
- path <optional>

### Postgres Args
- host
- port
- username
- password
- database

### Snowflake Args
- account
- username
- password


> [!TIP]
> The CLI can also be used for formatting. PreQL has a default formatting style that should always be adhered to. `trilogy fmt <path to preql file>`
