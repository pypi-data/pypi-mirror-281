Easy longform text generation.

## Known Issues
- Some modules are not being imported properly when the package is downloaded from PyPi. **PyPi releases have been yanked temporarily.**

## Roadmap
- [x] Add base features (ability to save/load model, change model configuration, training and eval utilities)
- [ ] Add utility functions for running the package in a Google Colab instance
- [ ] Add visualizers for training and evaluation
- [ ] Add live Google Colab demo to documentation

## Installation
Install from PyPI:
```
pip install andromeda-nlp
```

## Documentation
Read the documentation for this project [here.](https://andromeda-nlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Goals
- Serve as an easy-to-understand introduction to text generation, even for those with little to no programming experience
- The package should be modular and expandable; contributions are always encouraged
