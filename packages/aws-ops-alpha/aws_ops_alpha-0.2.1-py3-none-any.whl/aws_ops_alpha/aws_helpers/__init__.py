"""
This module defines the low-level implementation of the AWS ops automation steps.
Each step is a Python function focused on the core logic; it should neither print nor log,
and it should not determine whether the action should be executed.

The :mod:`aws_ops_alpha.project` module will call these functions.
For more details, please refer to the :mod:`aws_ops_alpha.project` module.
