# ImportDiff MkDocs Plugin

## Overview

The `ImportDiff` plugin for MkDocs allows you to dynamically replace custom code blocks in your Markdown files with the content of specified files. This plugin is particularly useful for managing and displaying differences between imported code files within your documentation.

## Features

- Configurable code block name to identify sections to be replaced.
- Automatically replaces matching code blocks with the content of specified files during the build process.
- Easy integration with existing MkDocs projects.

## Installation

To install the plugin, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install importdiff-mkdocs-plugin
```

## Configuration

To use the `ImportDiff` plugin, add it to your `mkdocs.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - importdiff:
      codeblock_name: import-diff-file  # Optional, default is 'import-diff-file'
```

## Usage

In your Markdown files, define code blocks with the specified code block name to be replaced by the plugin. For example:

<pre>
```
import-diff-file file=example.txt
```
</pre>

During the MkDocs build process, these code blocks will be replaced by the content of the specified file.

## Example

Given the following content in a Markdown file:

<pre>
```import-diff-file file=example.txt```
</pre>

The `ImportDiff` plugin will replace this block with the content of `example.txt`.
