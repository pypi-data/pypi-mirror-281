_Lightweight Instrument Display Interface for Aircraft_

lidia is a Python package for serving an aircraft instruments panel as a web page.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [lidia](https://pypi.org/project/lidia/).

```bash
pip install lidia
```

## Usage

```bash
lidia demo

# if your Scripts folder isn't in Path:
python3 -m lidia demo

# use other source
lidia rpctask

# show general help
lidia --help

# show help for a specific source
lidia demo --help

# pass the main server arguments before the source name
lidia -P 5556 demo
```

Then open the served page in a browser, by default [localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555).
The controls for showing and hiding elements of the GUI are shown when hovering the mouse in the bottom left region of the page.

## Support

Report problems in [GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/Maarrk/lidia/-/issues)

## Roadmap

- Set target state for `marsh` source using `ATTITUDE_TARGET` and `POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT`
- Command autocomplete (probably with [argcomplete](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/))
- Additional PFD indicators: ILS, VOR on HSI
- Ship approach screen with views from the side and behind
- CAS (Crew Alerting System) screen
- Simple second order aircraft models
- USB HID joystick source

## Contributing

- Contributions should be made to the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/Maarrk/lidia)
- Python code should be formatted with autopep8
- Other source files should be formatted with Prettier
- Install packages for development with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To properly run as a module without building and installing, **cd into `src/`** and run `python3 -m lidia`
- APIs deprecated in previous versions, waiting to be changed in next major release are marked with `@deprecated` comment
