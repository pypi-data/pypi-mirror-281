# Intro
> This project is a file downloader, supporting dynamic download according to the size of the file to choose the download mode, for the connection that supports breakpoint continuation will automatically break the connection, for the unsupported link will overwrite the previous content, the project includes retry mechanism, etc., currently supports: streaming download, large file fragment download.

# Give an example
```python
from yundownload import YunDownloader


download = YunDownloader(
    url='https://dldir1.qq.com/qqfile/qq/PCQQ9.7.17/QQ9.7.17.29225.exe',
    limit=1, # concurrency
    timeout=1000, # You are advised to set a longer timeout period for large file fragments because large file fragments exert pressure on the peer server
    dynamic_concurrency=True,
    save_path='QQ9.7.17.29225.exe'
)
# Files larger than this size are downloaded in fragments
download.DISTINGUISH_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024
# The size of each shard at download time
download.CHUNK_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024
# Heartbeat status detection time
download.HEARTBEAT_SLEEP = 1
# Run task. error_retry: Number of retries when an error occurs
download.run(error_retry=3)
```

# Update log
