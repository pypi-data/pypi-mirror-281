## Overview

This package provides tools for conducting CR3BP and ephemeris level analysis in cislunar and deep-space environments. 

While the library is implemented in python, the majority of functionalities are powered by either [SPICE routines](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/FORTRAN/spicelib/index.html) or through numpy/scipy/numba implementations, resulting in (relatively) fast computations. 
For numerical integration of ODEs, `paladin` provides the option of using either `scipy` or `gsl`; the latter is recommended due to higher accuracy. 

Optimization is conducted by constructing problems as [`pygmo` udp's](https://esa.github.io/pygmo2/index.html), which can then be solved through a variety of compatible solvers, including IPOPT, SNOPT, or WORHP (the latter two requires licenses). 


## Dependencies

Developed on python 3.10.

Package requirements: 
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `numba`, `scipy`, `spiceypy`, `sympy`

Optional:
- [`pygsl`](https://github.com/pygsl/pygsl/tree/main) : recommended for high-accuracy integration; requires `gsl` to be installed.
- `pygmo`, `pygmo_plugins_nonfree` : required for running trajectory construction problems


## SPICE setup

Users are responsible for downloading [the generic SPICE kernels froom the NAIF website](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/). In addition, supplementary custom kernels specific to this module are stored in `paladin/assets/spice/`. The most commonly required kernels are:

- `naif0012.tls`
- `de440.bsp`
- `gm_de440.tpc` 


## GSL setup

See [pygsl setup notes](./notes/pygsl_setup.md)


## Installation

This package is still in development. For now, please clone the repository and add to path.


## Capabilities

#### Roadmap

- [ ] GSL event capability
- [x] Propagation in CR3BP
- [x] Propagation in N-body problem
- [x] Transition to full-ephemeris model
- [x] Helper methods for frame transformation
