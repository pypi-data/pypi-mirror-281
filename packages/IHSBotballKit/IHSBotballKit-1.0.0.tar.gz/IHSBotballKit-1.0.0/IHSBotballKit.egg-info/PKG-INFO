An object-oriented wrapper for the KIPR Botball library with additional functionalities.

## Installation

The module is installed using pip:

```bash
pip install IHSBotballKit
```

## Usage

Documentation can be found in the source code or stubs. Examples use cases are provided in the examples folder.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow the following style guides:

- Use standard python syntax and naming conventions(e.g. snake_case for variables, CamelCase for classes).
-
- All importable members must be documented using [Google style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
- Type hinting is not required but strongly recommended whenever possible.
- It is recommended to use a static type checker such as [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) while contributing to the package.
- Create stubs in the stubs folder after you've made all the changes. A good way to do that is to use [mypy's stubgen](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html).
  - note: the stubs generated will have some issues and incomplete typing. It is your job to fix them before committing the code.

    ```bash
    # generate all the stubs at once
    stubgen -p ./IHSBotballKit -v --include-docstrings -o ./stubs
    # generate stubs for one (or more) file
    stubgen ./IHSBotballKit/file.py ./IHSBotballKit/file2.py -v --include-docstrings -0 ./stubs
    ```
