## About

![](img/page-teaser.png){: style="width:1550px"}

Axiros Low Code Platform (AX/LC) allows for the building of complex data processing pipelines, from

- an extendable set of small building blocks (operator functions)
- a declarative, composable description file, which can be editted e.g. visually. 

> An often drawn analogy to that approach is the one with Lego, which also allows to build complex designs, based on a set of generic and some design specifig blocks, plus a manual, describing how to put them together - while still allowing customization to a large extent.



### This Package

This is the core package for the Axiros Low Code Platform,
containing:

- The base platform ops and dev command line tools
- The python reference implementation of the AX/LC data pipeline building protocol
- The `ax.core` operator namespace, containing basic generic building blocks
- The  javascript running within Node-RED, enabling the AX/LC pipeline building protocol on Node-RED side.
