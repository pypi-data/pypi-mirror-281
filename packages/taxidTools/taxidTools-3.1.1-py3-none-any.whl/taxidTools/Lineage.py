    """
    Taxomic Lineage

    Defines a linear and ordered succession of Nodes.
    A Lineage is created by providing a single Node that
    will be used as a base to retrieve higher Nodes.
    Ranks are ascending by default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_node: taxidTools._Basenode
        An instance of a `taxidTools._BaseNode`subclass from which the ancestry
        should be retrieved
    ascending: bool, optional
        Should the Lineage by sorted by ascending ranks?

    Notes
    -----
    A Lineage does not have to be continuous. Nodes can have parents that
    are not included in the Lineage, as long as Nodes in a Lineage form a
    linear path.

    Lineage methods will never modify the Node objects it contains

    Examples
    --------
    >>> root = Node(1, "root", "root")
    >>> child1 = Node(2, "child1", "child_rank", root)
    >>> child2 = Node(3, "child2", "sub_child_rank", child1)
    >>> Lineage(child2)
    Lineage([Node(3), Node(2), Node(1)])

    Lineage elements are the Node objects themselves

    >>> Lineage(child2)[-1]
    Node object:
            Taxid: 1
            Name: root
            Rank: root
            Parent: None

    A Lineage can also be descending
    >>> Lineage(child2, ascending = False)
    Lineage([Node(1), Node(2), Node(3)])

        Filter a Lineage to a set of specified ranks.

        Modifies a Lineage in-place.
        Lineage order will not be conserved and dummy nodes will
        be added as placeholders for missing ranks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ranks: list, optional
            List of ranks to filter. It is assumed to be sorted
            in the same order as Lineage.

        Notes
        -----
        The Nodes are not modified by this method!
        That means that Node.parent will
        still point to the original parent Node,
        even if it was masked in the Lineage.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> root = Node(1, "root", "root")
        >>> child1 = Node(2, "child1", "child_rank", root)

        >>> lin
