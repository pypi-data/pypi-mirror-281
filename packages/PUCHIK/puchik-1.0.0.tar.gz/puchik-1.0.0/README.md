# PUCHIK

Python Utility for Characterizing Heterogeneous Interfaces and Kinetics (PUCHIK), is a tool for analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories. It allows constructing an interface between two phases, enabling to calculate intrinsic density profiles, volumes, etc.

The interface construction works for spherical and rod-like nanoparticles equally well, making it a great tool to work with nanoparticles of almost every shape.

## Installation

You can install the PUCHIK package using pip:

```
pip install PUCHIK
```

## Usage

The main class in this package is the "Mesh" class. To set up a mesh, import it from PUCHIK:

```python
from PUCHIK import Mesh
```

You should provide it with a topology and optionally a trajectory files. AICON uses MDAnalysis Readers to open a trajectory. You can find the supported formats [here](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html).

```python
trj = '<path_to_trajectory>'
top = '<path_to_topology>'
m = Mesh(trj, top)
```

Lastly, select the atom groups you want to consider, atom groups that comprise the interface, and run the **calculate_density** method:

```python
m.select_atoms('all')  # Consider every atom in the system
m.select_structure('<resname_of_the_nanoparticle>')  # resname of the nanoparticle
# m.select_structure(['<resname_1>', '<resname_2>'])  # use a list if it's a mix of residues

density_selection = 'resname TIP3'
m.calculate_density(density_selection)
```

Note that **calculate_density** uses every CPU core. You can specify the number of cores you want to use with the keyword argument **cpu_count**.

A more customized usage of the **calculate_density** method can be:

```python
m.calculate_density(density_selection, start=10, end=1000, skip=2, norm_bin_count=12)
```

This version will start the calculation at the 10th frame and finish it at frame 1000 considering every 2nd frame. **norm_bin_count** specifies the number of divisions of the simulation box in each dimension to create a grid.
