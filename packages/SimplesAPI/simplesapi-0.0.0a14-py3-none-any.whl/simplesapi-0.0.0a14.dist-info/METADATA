# SimplesAPI

**SimplesAPI** is a **Python-based application framework** designed to simplify the implementation of various functionalities such as database connections, structured logging, event dispatching, bucket access, and queue processing. By **reducing code repetition** and **enhancing code readability**, SimpleAPI allows developers to focus on solving business problems and rapidly create Proof of Concepts (POCs).

</p>

## Features (WIP)
- Database Connections: Seamlessly connect to different types of databases with minimal configuration.
- Structured Logging: Implement structured and meaningful logs effortlessly.
- Event Dispatching: Send and handle events with ease.
- Bucket Access: Access and manage data stored in buckets.
- Queue Processing: Send messages to and retrieve messages from processing queues.
- Code Simplicity: Reduce boilerplate code to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.
- Rapid POC Development: Quickly develop and iterate on Proof of Concepts.

## Installation
To install SimplesAPI, simply run:

```bash
pip install simplesapi
```

# Getting Started

## Basic Setup
The main entry point of your application (main.py) should be set up as follows:

```python
from simplesapi.app import SimplesAPI
app = SimplesAPI(routes_path="routes")
```

## Folder Structure
SimpleAPI uses a folder structure to define routes. For example, to create a GET route for /users/{userId}, the folder structure should be:
```
routes/health-check__GET.py
routes/users/POST.py
routes/users/[userId]__GET.py
routes/users/DELETE.py
routes/users/PATCH.py
```

## Route Handler
Inside the route file ([userId]__GET.py), you should define an asynchronous handler function:
```python
async def handler(userId: str):
    return {"id": userId}
```

## Running
```
uvicorn main:app
```
