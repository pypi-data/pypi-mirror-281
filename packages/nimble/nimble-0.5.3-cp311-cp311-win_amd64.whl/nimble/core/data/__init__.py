"""
Contains the hierarchy of objects which can be used to store data
in nimble.

Object creation is meant to be done via nimble top level functions such
as nimble.data, even though the objects themselves are contained
within this module. They are available only for the purposes of instance
checking, and are excluded from __all__ and the automatically generated
documentation.
