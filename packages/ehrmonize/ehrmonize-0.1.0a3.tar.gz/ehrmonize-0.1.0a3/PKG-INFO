# EHRmonize

Welcome to `EHRmonize`, a Python package to abstract medical concepts using large language models.

## Citation

> TBD, stay tuned!


## Motivation
Processing and harmonizing the vast amounts of data captured in complex electronic health records (EHR) is a challenging and costly task that requires clinical expertise. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various healthcare-related tasks. We herein introduce `EHRmonize`, a framework designed to abstract EHR medical concepts using LLMs.

## Rationale
`EHRmonize` is designed with two main components: a corpus generation and an LLM inference pipeline. The **first step** entails querying the EHR databases to extract and the text/concepts across various data domains that need categorization. The **second step** employs LLM few-shot prompting across different tasks. The objective is to leverage the vast medical text exposure of LLMs to convert raw input medication data into useful, predefined classes.
