# Botometer X Python API

A Python API for [Botometer X by OSoMe](https://osome.iu.edu).
Previously known as `botornot-python`.

Behind the scenes, this uses the Botometer's HTTP endpoint, available via
[RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/OSoMe/api/botometer-pro).

RapidAPI usage/account related questions should be posted on RapidAPI discussion.

## [Change Note/Announcement]

### June, 2024

We are releasing a new API endpoint for Botometer X.

Unlike the original Botometer that fetched data from Twitter and calculated bot scores on the fly, Botometer X is in archival mode and relies on pre-calculated scores based on historical data collected before June 2023.
The API endpoint allows users to fetch scores in bulk using a list of user ids or screen names, without the need of a Twitter/X's developer account.

For details of Botometer X, please refer to the [FQA](https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/faq).


## Help
> You probably want to have a look at [Troubleshooting & FAQ](https://github.com/osome-iu/botometer-python/wiki/Troubleshooting-&-FAQ) in the wiki. Please feel free to suggest and/or contribute improvements to that page.

## Prior to Utilizing Botometer
To begin using Botometer X, you must follow the steps below before running any code:
1. Create a free [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) account.
2. Subscribe to [Botometer Pro](https://rapidapi.com/OSoMe/api/botometer-pro) on RapidApi by selecting a plan.
    > There is a completely free version (which does not require any credit card information) for testing purposes.
3. Ensure Botometer Pro's dependencies are already installed.
    > See the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section for details.

## Quickstart
From your command shell, run

```
pip install botometer
```

### Botometer X

To access the Botometer X endpoint, enter something like this in a Python shell or script:

```python
import botometer

rapidapi_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

bomx = botometer.BotometerX(rapidapi_key=rapidapi_key)
```


```python
# Check accounts by usernames, note that @ is optional
bomx.get_botscores_in_batch(usernames=['@OSoMe_IU', 'botometer'])

# Check accounts by ids
bomx.get_botscores_in_batch(user_ids=[2451308594, 187521608])

# Check accounts by both usernames and ids
bomx.get_botscores_in_batch(usernames=['@OSoMe_IU'], user_ids=[2451308594])
```

The queries will return results like those below:

```json
[
    {
        "bot_score": 0.09,
        "timestamp": "Sat, 27 May 2023 23:57:16 GMT",
        "user_id": "2451308594",
        "username": "Botometer"
    },
    {
        "bot_score": 0.21,
        "timestamp": "Thu, 25 May 2023 22:54:53 GMT",
        "user_id": "187521608",
        "username": "OSoMe_IU"
    }
]
```
The response will be a list of JSON objects.
Meanings of the elements in the object:
- `bot_score`: The bot score, a float number between 0 and 1
- `timestamp`: The time when the bot score was calculated
- `user_id`: ID of the account
- `username`: Username of the account
