'''
Middleware for a server deployment.  This is designed
to sit between the SDTP objects (in sdtp)
and a server.  These objects provide two principal
functions:
1. Keep the set of tables by name
2. Handle authentication on a table-specific basis
3. Convert results into the wire format for transmission

There are two major classes: 
1. Table, which provides a wrapper around the SDTP Table with the table's
   name, authentication requirememts, and result-conversion utilities
2. TableServer, which provides a registry and lookup service to Tables
