    BuildingPlanExtensions is a class for extending the functionality of the :class:`~compas_timber.planning.BuildingPlan` class.

    The BuildingPlanExtensions class provides additional functionalities to the :class:`~compas_timber.planning.BuildingPlan`
    by providing a way to create a buildling plan from an established assembly sequence.
