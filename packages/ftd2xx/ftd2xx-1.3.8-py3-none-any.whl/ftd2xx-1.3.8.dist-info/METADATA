ftd2xx is a simple python wrapper around the `D2XX DLL`_ from FTDI using
ctypes. The API based on Pablo Bleyer Kocik's d2xx_ extension.

Requires Python 3.8 minimum. Please ensure you have FTDI drivers installed or
available where the linker looks for shared libraries (e.g., PATH on windows,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or standard library directories on Linux)

I don't have time to maintain this project, so I am looking for a maintainer.

There is another library by pyftdi_ that looks more actively maintained, has support for newer device, and may fit your needs better.

Also, Jeremy Bentham wrote a blog_ about using this library.
