<p>
<tt>.mov</tt> files produced by iMovie use a naming scheme that
has embedded spaces and does not preserve the time order in the
alphabetic listing.
The iMovie naming scheme:</p>
<pre class="source">
YYYY-MM-DD &lt;space&gt; HH-MM-SS [-N].mov
</pre>
<p>
The disambiguation number -N is optional.  Because hyphen is less than period in
ASCII order, the first file comes last, in a group of files sharing
the same date and time.</p>
<p>
To fix this, <tt>mvmov</tt> renames all the files in the current
directory to:</p>
<pre class="source">
YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-N.mov
</pre>

<h3>Flags</h3>
<ul>
<li><tt>-c</tt> Check that all filenames have either the expected
  input format or the output format.</li>
<li><tt>-n</tt> Dry run.</li>
<li><tt>-b</tt> Make batches.  Filenames are not changed, but
 numbered subdirectories <tt>000</tt>, <tt>001</tt>, etc., are
 created, each containing 100 files.  Only as a desperation
 measure.</li>
</ul>
