<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="nav"><a href="index.html">Core Seal Documentation</a></p>
<p>
This manual describes the implementation and source-code organization
of Seal, for those who might wish to modify it.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>
In this chapter, the source directory for Seal is referred to as <tt>$SEAL</tt>.
It is created by unpacking a tar file or by cloning from the git repository,
and is usually named <tt>seal</tt> or
<tt>seal-<i>x.x.x</i></tt>.
It has the following toplevel listing:
<pre>
Makefile      cx          doc          python
configure     data        examples     scripts
</pre>
<p>
The directory into which Seal is installed is referred to
as <tt>$DEST</tt>.  By default it is the same as <tt>$SEAL</tt>, but
it can specified by passing <tt>--prefix=<i>dir</i></tt>
to the <tt>configure</tt> script.</p>
<p>
The examples assume the following environment variable settings:
<ul>
<li><tt>PATH</tt> includes <tt>$DEST/bin</tt></li>
<li><tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> includes <tt>$DEST/python</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>
The python examples assume that one has done:</p>
<pre class="python">
>>> import seal
</pre>
<p>
A first test:</p>
<pre class="python">
>>> seal.hello()
Hello.  This is Seal ...
</pre>
<p>
The actual output will have the version number in place of ... .</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

The "pure Python" subset of Seal requires no installation.  One only
needs to assure that <tt>$SEAL/python</tt> is included on one's
<tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>.</p>
<p>
For full functionality, go to the <tt>$SEAL</tt> directory and do:</p>
<pre class="source">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
<p>
Installation in an external directory is not necessary, provided that
<tt>$SEAL/python</tt> is included on <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>.  If installation
in an external directory is desired, one may specify it when calling
<tt>configure</tt>:</p>
<pre class="source">
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
