## Installation

```bash
pip install fixml

# For unix-like systems e.g. Linux, macOS 
export OPENAI_API_KEY={your-openai-api-key}

# For windows systems
set OPENAI_API_KEY={your-openai-api-key}
```

For more detailed installation guide,
visit [the related page on ReadtheDocs](https://fixml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Usage

### CLI tool

FixML offers a CLI command to quick and easy way to evaluate existing tests and
generate new ones.

#### Test Evaluator

Here is an example command to evaluate a local repo:

```bash
fixml evaluate /path/to/your/repo \
  --export_report_to=./eval_report.html --verbose
```

#### Test Spec Generator

Here is an example command to evaluate a local repo
```bash
fixml generate test.py
```

> [!TIP]
> Run command `fixml {evaluate|generate} --help` for more information and all
> available options.
>
> You can also refer
> to [our Quickstart guide](https://fixml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
> on more detailed walkthrough on how to use the CLI tool.

### Package

Alternatively, you can use the package to import all components necessary for
running the evaluation/generation workflows listed above.

Consult [our documentation on using the API](https://fixml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-api.html)
for more information and example calls.
