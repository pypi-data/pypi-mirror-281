    text = "DimitriIt doesn’t take Alexei very long to convince Azura to come back. She had told him that she had been keeping an eye on the situation between me and Arashi; she knew that she would be needed again and was ready to help.She arrives a few short hours after she had been sent for, something about the perks of having old friends in high places. I suppose it has something to do with magic, though it isn’t really my business so I don’t bother to ask; I’m much more concerned with other matters to be quite honest. Azura hasn’t changed very much since the last time I had seen her; not that it was any surprise.Witches and Warlocks are suspended in time, mortal but never showing any sign of aging. Such a feat meant that they tended to live almost 10 times the lifespan of a human, that is until they were hunted to near extinction.The only noticeable change that I can find is her hair, which was once dark and braided, is now platinum blonde and has been dip-dyed an electric purple. I guess she had near eternity to do whatever the hell she wanted with herself. She wanders into the office in front of Alexei, the beta in question nodding his dismissal before shutting the door. She gives the room a few cursory glances, as if to take in the changes herself; I’m not proud that a lot of things have become more disorderly since Arashi left, including my office. She looks towards me, a brow arches in interest, seemingly amused by the sight before her. No doubt she is marvelling at the fact that the ‘big bad alpha’ has been brought to his knees by his vanishing mate. “You wolves are interesting creatures. Such strength and power, but your strengths are also your weaknesses.” She muses as she plops herself on the leather sofa. The same sofa she had used when she had ‘unlocked’ Arashi’s mind all those months ago.I clear my throat, resisting the urge to growl. Although she is right, I don’t appreciate her calling me weak, especially when it comes to Arashi. “I need your help.”“Help isn’t free, you know this.” She stares at me with dark eyes, my heart heavy as the price that I have already paid to help Arashi the last time, coming back to me. “Are you willing to give up more than you already have?” My silence hangs heavily in the air- what more can I give up? Can I give more than I already have? My mind drifts back to the first time Azura had come to the pack in order to help Arashi.Arashi had been so full of fire and determination, I knew that she was beyond frustrated even if she wouldn’t say. Honestly it was beyond sexy, not that I could say such a thing in front of my pack members- ranked or not. “Your mate is a complicated case, it will cost you dearly.” She had said. It wasn’t malicious or greedy, not like most witches or warlocks were stereotypically presented. “I’ll pay you anything you want. Just give her her memories back.” I grunted without hesitation, regardless of the way I acted, I only wanted what was best for my mate. I could tell she was in a lot of pain, and turmoil- she had so many barriers up. I wanted her to be able to trust me, to depend on me if there was anything she needed or wanted. I never wanted it to be said that I couldn’t care for or provide for my mate. My father had taught me better than that and I intended to act as such. “You misunderstand.” Azura spoke softly, quietly. There was a sad, almost deadly quality to her words. I could tell that whatever she wanted to say, it weighed heavily upon her and I probably would not like it. “Magic is like energy, it isn’t created out of nothing, it’s an  exchange. To receive one thing, is to give up another. To give her the past, you must give up your future. If I do this, you and your mate will never have pups.”“What?” My heart skipped a beat, the silence around me deafening. Helping her would mean giving up everything for her- my legacy as an Alpha, being able to have a family. Things that I had always wanted, things that were expected of me. I’d have to throw them all away?For a second I doubted that I could, my father had always taught me that my duty was to my pack first before it was to my mate. Any ′good’ Alpha would turn down such a proposal in a heartbeat. Too bad I was a selfish bastard.Just having her would be more than enough for me; she needed this more than I needed to be Alpha, or needed to have a family. I would have to sort something out when the time came for me to step down, but I knew that making this choice was best for everyone. This was bigger than us all, she had said. She needed her memories. It was a heavy price to pay, but it was worth it, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would give more if it meant that she would be able to come back and be by my side. “For her, anything.” I grunt, determination lining my tone and features. I mean every word that I say- she deserves so much.I often find myself wishing that I hadn’t wasted all the time that I had with her before, that I had given her the relationship, the life that she should have had. We had spent a little less than a month together, but I’ve still come to respect her and even love her- perhaps we would’ve had a chance to bond more if we hadn’t put up facades and barriers.“Hold on, before you sell something that you don’t have to give, let me see if I can actually help.”  Azura held her hand out to stop me. She has a glint in her eyes perhaps akin to pride or respect, though I can’t decipher exactly what it means. I’m not entirely sure I want to. She makes me lie down on the leather sofa, the thing too small to fit my entire frame. I remember when Arashi had been in my place; the sofa looked much bigger, though I guess Arashi is just small. She’s a whole foot shorter than me- not that it stops her from being fierce or strong; she could probably even take me out if she wants to.  My head rests against the armrest, as I try to shift into a somewhat comfortable position, but regardless of how I shuffle it is still ridiculously awkward. Azura looks half amused at my shifting, probably knowing that my lack of comfort is imminent. She comes beside me, kneeling as she places her fingers to my temples, a short, sharp pinch catching me off guard. It feels like an electric shock, and a pushing into my subconscious mind- like a mind link, only more foreign. I can practically feel her as she rummages around in my mind for a few moments. If I knew how to be embarrassed I might be, though emotions like that are not becoming of a male, especially not an Alpha. I have been trained to be as unflinching as steel, as have all my men. She withdraws, and I feel the disconnect as she leaves my mind. My head feels a little strange but nonetheless unchanged that I can tell anyway. What frightens me more is her thoughtful expression before she finally spoke.“I cannot help you, there is nothing wrong with your bond. I don’t really know why you can’t communicate with your mate, I am sorry Alpha Dimitri.” She scratches her chin lightly as I sit up, stretching my back from the cramped position. “My guess is that your mate probably still has barriers up, she probably needs them in Shadow Fang. Perhaps try calling to her late at night when she might be asleep? You may reach her in a dream realm.”“Do you think it’s possible?” I ask. I have never heard of such things, in fact it has never been taught, in all the generations of the White Claw pack, that such a thing is even feasible. “Alpha, anything is possible. Mates are supposed to be connected in ways greater than we can imagine. Besides, I hear your Moon Goddess makes way for special cases, and you and your mate are most definitely nothing short of remarkable.” She says with a small smile. “Well thank you very much for coming, though I fear that I’ve wasted your time.” I stand, offering my hand to hers for her also to stand. She stands beside me and a small smile rested on her features, it almost made her appear younger.“Not at all. I do wish you both the best of luck. And know that my services are freely offered to you now. I have a feeling you will need them once again before all this is through.”I simply nod, and that is all she needs before she vanishes in a cloud of thick blue smoke. All I can do is hope that she is somehow right, and hope that whatever Arashi is doing, she’s okay and managing to stay alive. Arashi.ArashiI fall back into my routine at ShadowFang quite easily, and for the most part everything is like it used to be. I think I’ve managed to convince everyone that I’m not some kind of threat or a traitor. The little story that I had fed them about making sure the other packs were ignorant was received well, and is more than welcomed. It has definitely quelled a lot of the anxieties going around the pack, that along with some embellished bullshit information that I made up, that now has them thinking they would be able to dominate.In all honesty, I fear that I haven’t lied at all. ShadowFang is a strong force- unnatural and dangerous. From what I saw in Dimitri’s pack, White Claw are strong, but not strong enough or prepared to face anything on the scale of an attack from ShadowFang. But if Dimitri can bring together all the packs then it would definitely set Shadow Fang back. Shadow Fang is unusually large with nearly 150 wolves, most of whom are genetically modified hybrids. And whilst most Shadow Fang warriors can easily wipe the floor with any wolf that comes our way, if the other packs could manage a good strategic, calculated attack it could pose a threat to Shadow Fangs warriors. Especially since Aleksandr isn’t one to carefully plan out strategies. That with the added fact that the packs won’t be alone; Zakhar and I have been trying to amass an underground network within the pack. I have no doubt our number will be small, but it will still make every difference- one more as part of our resistance, meant one less to fight- to kill- in a war.I’ve been more concerned about staying under the radar, especially since Bogdan has been determined to keep a close eye on me, however, Zakhar had assured me that our little club was growing. We still have to be very careful, one wrong word said to the wrong person and we would all be discovered as traitors. I have no doubt that Aleksandr would make us wish for death long before he ended us. I block another one of Zakhar’s punches as he comes at me relentlessly, I know I’m going to be covered in bruises for a while after sparring. He lands another punch to my face, my entire cheek bone vibrating with the impact. My already pounding head aching with the impact. The feeling is disorienting, but I push the mixing migraine and light headedness to focus on the battle in front of me. With so many eyes on me I can’t afford to appear weak; I’d rather pass out whilst working hard than pussyfooting, and whining about the pain. Maybe Dimitri might have told me to take a break, catch my breath, nurse the headache- but Dimitri isn’t here. There is no room for that here. The headache lightens a moment, as his face comes to my mind’s eye, but I push it away before it can do any real damage. I shake my head, focusing back on Zakhar's form- knees bent, arms up, eyes determined. “Come on Hell bringer? What have you been doing for the last couple months, sucking dick all day?” I hiss at him, baring my fangs. I feel a surge within as the demon within tries to tear through me, coming to the forefront of my mind as she tries to consume me. I hold her back, but I allow her to change me, the way I would shift into my wolf. The beast, the demon, and the human had agreed long ago over this metamorphosis. The demon hated everything, but somewhere between the thousand whip lashes, the starvation and humiliation she decided she hated Aleksandr more. The wolf that had once retreated within me, was called forth and submitted to this newer, more powerful entity within. If I hadn’t had my own intense rage and hatred for Aleksandr, she might have consumed me too. I vowed then that I would kill Aleksandr, and she would give me the power to do it. Unlike a shift, the change was almost instantaneous, though still incredibly painful. It’s a pain that has been conditioned into me, and whilst raw and brutal, I feel a great power, a sense of purpose and control every time it comes over me.Everywhere burns, like the fire of hell itself is rushing through me. It starts at my fingertips, my fingers bending and spasming like the final moments of a spider’s life. Death and decay take over, my nails turning to black, elongating into long black knife-like talons. Matching obsidian scales grow in small patches like petals of wilting flowers across my body.  The worst pain is in my back, hellfire coupled with the tearing of flesh and the muscle underneath, as two huge, black leathery wings rip through my back. “Oh, didn’t like that, did you?” Zakhar continues to taunt. I know that he doesn’t really mean any of it, his ego only feels inflated because I haven’t knocked him on his ass yet. I’m more than happy to put him back in his place.I swing my leg out lightning fast in a clean roundhouse kick that clips his chin before pulling back and extending again into his chest, sending him a few feet back. My wings spread behind me, catching the wind as they flapped. My eyes follow him as he looks around, I land right behind him before he manages to look up, sending a kick to the back of his knees. The final blow is an elbow to the face at the exact moment he turns to look at me, I feel the crunch of his cartilage in his nose when I make contact. I manage to actually knock him out for a couple minutes. I kick his half-conscious form with a raised brow and a small smirk playing at my features. He looks up with a bruised face and a bloody nose, a bored expression on his face. “Even after sucking dick all day, I can still kick your ass.” He looks at me with a strange look before it disappears behind his usual serious gaze. I fight off a groan as another headache grows in my temples, this time it feels as though someone is skewering my brain with a red hot poker. “Training is over, let’s hit the showers.” Zakhar grabs my hand to pull himself up. I follow behind him, the headache starting to clear away a little bit. After a shower, I would probably feel a whole lot better too. I can’t help feeling guilty, just getting on with everyday activities when war is brewing. I know there isn’t much else I can do for now, but I still feel as though I should be doing something. I just hope that Dimitri is okay and getting things ready for when shit hits the fan. His face appears in my mind, and I feel a tug in my heart. Then for a brief moment, something else happens and it shakes me to the core. The sound of his voice for the briefest of seconds, like if he is calling out to me in a ghost’s whisper. I had to have imagined it right? Arashi."
