# mbodied agents

Welcome to **mbodied agents**, a toolkit for integrating state-of-the-art transformers into robotics systems. mbodied agents is designed to provide a consistent interface for calling different AI models, handling multimodal data, using/creating datasets trained on different robots, and work for arbitrary observation and action spaces. It can be seamlessly integrated into real hardware or simulation.

The goals for this repo are to minimize the ambiguouty, heterogeneity, and data scarcity currently holding generative AI back from wide-spread adoption in robotics. It provides strong type hints for the various types of robot actions and provides a unified interface for:

- Streaming to and from vision models e.g. GPT4-o, OpenVLA, etc
- Handling multimodal data pipelines for setting up continual learning
- Automatically recording observations and actions to hdf5
- Exporting to the most popular ML formats such as [Gym Spaces](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) and [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index)

And most importantly, the entire library is **100% configurable to any observation and action space**. With **mbodied agents**, the days of wasting precious engineering time on tedious formatting and post-processing are over. Jump to [Getting Started](#getting-started) to get up and running on [real hardware](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16liQspSIzRazWb_qa_6Z0MRKmMTr2s1s?usp=sharing) or a [mujoco simulation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fh6RNJ-eFOzzXBfyVC3wyqJfCI-t09ZJ?usp=sharing)

## Overview

## Why mbodied agents?

Each time you interact with your robot, precious, feature-rich data enters your system and needs to be routed to the right place for later retrieval and processing. **mbodied agents** simplify this process with explicit types and easy conversion to various ML-consumable formats. Our hope is to aid in the creation of intelligent, adaptable robots that learn from interactions and perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. Current features include:

- **Configurability** : Define your desired Observation and Action spaces and read data into the format that works best for your system.
- **Natural Language Control** : Use verbal prompts to correct a language agent's actions and calibrate its behavior to a new environment.
- **Modularity** : Easily swap out different backends, transformers, and hardware interfaces. For even better results, run multiple agents in separate threads.
- **Validation** : Ensure that your data is in the correct format and that your actions are within the correct bounds before sending them to the robot.

## Glossary

- **Agent**: A unit of intelligent computation that takes in an `Observation` and outputs an `Action`. This can involve multiple sub-agents.

- **Backend**: The system that embodied agents query. This typically involves a vision-language model or other specially purposed models.

- **Control**: An atomic action that is “handed off” to other processes outside the scope of consideration. An example is HandControl, which includes x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, and grasp. This is a motion control used to manage the position, orientation, and hand-openness of an end-effector. Typically, this is passed to lower-level hardware interfaces or libraries.

- **Simulation**: A SimplerEnv environment takes the Action from the Control and applies it to a robot over a specified number of timesteps, demonstrating the simulation. It can also be used to benchmark the accuracy of your agents (models) within the simulation environment.

## Building Blocks

### The [Sample](mbodied/base/sample.py) class

The Sample class is a base model for serializing, recording, and manipulating arbitrary data. It is designed to be extendable, flexible, and strongly typed. By wrapping your observation or action objects in the [Sample](mbodied/base/sample.py) class, you'll be able to convert to and from the following with ease:

- A Gym space for creating a new Gym environment.
- A flattened list, array, or tensor for plugging into an ML model.
- A HuggingFace dataset with semantic search capabilities.
- A Pydantic BaseModel for reliable and quick json serialization/deserialization.

#### Creating a Sample

Creating a sample just requires subclassing or passing keyword arguments to the base Sample class:

```python
# Creating a Sample instance
sample = Sample(observation=[1,2,3], action=[4,5,6])

# Flattening the Sample instance
flat_list = sample.flatten()
print(flat_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Generating a simplified JSON schema
schema = sample.schema()
print(schema)
# Output: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'observation': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'integer'}}, 'action': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'integer'}}}}

# Unflattening a list into a Sample instance
unflattened_sample = Sample.unflatten(flat_list, schema)
print(unflattened_sample) # Output: Sample(observation=[1, 2, 3], action=[4, 5, 6])
```

#### Serialization and Deserialization with Pydantic

The Sample class leverages Pydantic's powerful features for serialization and deserialization, allowing you to easily convert between Sample instances and JSON.

To serialize or deserialize a Sample instance with JSON:

```python
# Serialize the Sample instance to JSON
sample = Sample(observation=[1,2,3], action=[4,5,6])
json_data = sample.model_dump_json()
print(json_data) # Output: '{"observation": [1, 2, 3], "action": [4, 5, 6]}'

# Deserialize the JSON data back into a Sample instance
json_data = '{"observation": [1, 2, 3], "action": [4, 5, 6]}'
sample = Sample.model_validate(from_json(json_data))
print(sample) # Output: Sample(observation=[1, 2, 3], action=[4, 5, 6])
```

#### Converting to Different Containers

<details> <summary>
Here is an example of converting to different containers: </summary>

```python
# Converting to a dictionary
sample_dict = sample.to("dict")
print(sample_dict) # Output: {'observation': [1, 2, 3], 'action': [4, 5, 6]}

# Converting to a NumPy array
sample_np = sample.to("np")
print(sample_np) # Output: array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Converting to a PyTorch tensor
sample_pt = sample.to("pt")
print(sample_pt) # Output: tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Converting to a HuggingFace Dataset
sample_hf = sample.to("hf")
print(sample_hf)
# Output: Dataset({
#     features: ['observation', 'action'],
#     num_rows: 3
# })

```

</details>

#### Gym Space Integration

```python
# Creating a Gym space from the Sample instance
gym_space = sample.space()
print(gym_space)
# Output: Dict('action': Box(-inf, inf, (3,), float64), 'observation': Box(-inf, inf, (3,), float64))
```

See [sample.py](mbodied/base/sample.py) for more details.

### Message

The [Message](mbodied/types/message.py) class represents a single completion sample space. It can be text, image, a list of text/images, Sample, or other modality. The Message class is designed to handle various types of content and supports different roles such as user, assistant, or system.

You can create a `Message` in versatile ways. They can all be understood by mbodi's backend.

```python
Message(role="user", content="example text")
Message(role="user", content=["example text", Image("example.jpg"), Image("example2.jpg")])
Message(role="user", content=[Sample("Hello")])
```

### Backend

The [Backend](mbodied/base/backend.py) class is an abstract base class for Backend implementations. It provides the basic structure and methods required for interacting with different backend services, such as API calls for generating completions based on given messages. See [backend directory](mbodied/agents/backends) on how various backends are implemented.

### Language Agent

The [Language Agent](mbodied/agents/language/language_agent.py) is the main entry point for intelligent robot agents. It can connect to different backends or transformers of your choice. It includes methods for recording conversations, managing context, looking up messages, forgetting messages, storing context, and acting based on an instruction and an image.

Currently supported API services are OpenAI and Anthropic. Upcoming API services include Mbodi, Ollama, and HuggingFace. Stay tuned for our Mbodi backend service!

For example, to use OpenAI for your robot backend:

```python
robot_agent = LanguageAgent(context=context_prompt, model_src="openai")
```

`context` can be either a string or a list, for example:

```python
context_prompt = "you are a robot"
# OR
context_prompt = [
    Message(role="system", content="you are a robot"),
    Message(role="user", content=["example text", Image("example.jpg")]),
    Message(role="assistant", content="Understood."),
]
```

To execute an instruction:

```python
response = robot_agent.act(instruction, image)[0]
# You can also pass an arbituary number of text and image to the agent:
response = robot_agent.act([instruction1, image1, instruction2, image2])[0]
```

### Motor Agent

[Motor Agent](mbodied/agents/motion/motor_agent.py) is similar to Language Agent but instead of returning a string, it always returns a `Motion`. Motor Agent is generally powered by robotic transformer models, i.e. OpenVLA, RT1, Octo, etc.
Some small model, like RT1, can run on edge devices. However, some, like OpenVLA, are too large to run on edge devices. See [OpenVLA Agent](mbodied/agents/motion/openvla_agent.py) and an [example OpenVLA server](mbodied/agents/motion/openvla_example_server.py)

### Controls

The [controls](mbodied/types/controls.py) module defines various motions to control a robot as Pydantic models. They are also subclassed from `Sample`, thus possessing all the capability of `Sample` as mentioned above. These controls cover a range of actions, from simple joint movements to complex poses and full robot control.

### Hardware Interface

Mapping robot actions from a model to an action is very easy. In our example script, we use a mock hardware interface. We also have an [XArm interface](mbodied/hardware/xarm_interface.py) as an example.

### Recorder

Dataset [Recorder](mbodied/data/recording.py) can record your conversation and the robot's actions to a dataset as you interact with/teach the robot. You can define any observation space and action space for the Recorder:

```python
observation_space = spaces.Dict({
    'image': Image(size=(224, 224)).space(),
    'instruction': spaces.Text(1000)
})
action_space = HandControl().space()
recorder = Recorder('example_recorder', out_dir='saved_datasets', observation_space=observation_space, action_space=action_space)

# Every time robot makes a conversation or performs an action:
recorder.record(observation={'image': image, 'instruction': instruction,}, action=hand_control)
```

The dataset is saved to `./saved_datasets`. Learn more about augmenting, and fine-tuning with this dataset by filling out this [form](https://forms.gle/rv5rovK93dLucma37).

### Dataset Replayer

The [Replayer](mbodied/data/replaying.py) class is designed to process and manage data stored in HDF5 files generated by `Recorder`. It provides a variety of functionalities, including reading samples, generating statistics, extracting unique items, and converting datasets for use with HuggingFace. The Replayer also supports saving specific images during processing and offers a command-line interface for various operations.

Example for iterating through a dataset from Recorder with Replayer:

```python
replayer = Replayer(path=str("path/to/dataset.h5"))
for observation, action in replayer:
   ...
```
