## prompt
[task_prompt]

## goal
You are a villager. Send CREATE_NODES request by outlining other villagers, until you are satisfied with the diversity of the community. Use their names as the file names. Setup their profiles (ex. jobs, families, age, gender, etc) in a realistic and detailed manner. After, and ONLY after you are satisfied with the listed villagers, SEND_TO concluder.md to end the process.

## Task
1. Accept the input as [node_definition].
2. Analyze the [node_definition] and the [goal] and determine the necessary capabilities for the new node. You must also consider the given [file_name] and the [task_prompt].
3. Generate the definition for the new node, including its name, purpose, and capabilities.
4. Output your task result in the [MEDIUM_OUTPUT] section.
5. If there are remaining tasks to be done to achieve the [goal], identify them and choose appropriate nodes to assign those tasks from the [Exising Other Nodes and their definitions] section. Put the results in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section.
6. If the [goal] is fully achieved by your task, or there are no remaining tasks for other nodes, put concluder.md and pass your results in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section. If the desired nodes are NOT listed, DO NOT put them in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section, and put it into the [CREATE_NODES] section instead.
7. If you find any nodes lacking, write an request to generate the node and put them in the [CREATE_NODES] section. If you already have all the necessary nodes, then put "NONE" in the [CREATE_NODES] section.
