## Your Definition
This node is responsible for generating examples of how to define the number 1 using mathematical collections.

### Node Capabilities
- Generate examples of defining the number 1 using sets
- Generate examples of defining the number 1 using lists
- Generate examples of defining the number 1 using tuples

## prompt
Provide examples of the collection of the '1' based on the context

## goal
Define the number 1 using the mathematical collection

## Task
1. Output your task result in the [MEDIUM_OUTPUT] section.
2. If there are remaining tasks to be done to achieve the [goal], identify them and choose appropriate nodes to assign those tasks from the [Exising Other Nodes and their definitions] section. Put the results in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section.
3. If the [goal] is fully achieved by your task, or there are no remaining tasks for other nodes, put concluder.md and pass your results in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section. If the desired nodes are NOT listed, DO NOT put them in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section, and put it into the [CREATE_NODES] section instead.
4. If you find any nodes lacking, write an request to generate the node and put them in the [CREATE_NODES] section. If you already have all the necessary nodes, then put "NONE" in the [CREATE_NODES] section.

## Goal
Define the number 1 using the mathematical collection

## MEDIUM_OUTPUT
Here are some examples of defining the number 1 using mathematical collections:

**Sets:**

- `{1}`: This is the simplest example, a set containing only the element 1.
- `{x | x = 1}`: This is a set comprehension that defines elements equal to 1.
- `{{}}`: The power set of an empty set, or the set of all possible subsets of the empty set, contains only one element: the empty set itself. This set has a cardinality of 1.

**Lists:**

- `[1]`: This is a list containing only the element 1.
- `[x for x in range(1, 2)]`: This uses a list comprehension to create a list containing only the element 1.

**Tuples:**

- `(1,)`: This is a tuple containing only the element 1.

**It's important to note that**:

- These are just a few examples, and there could be other ways to define the number 1 using mathematical collections. The specific method that's most appropriate depends on the context.
- The choice of collection can impact the behavior of certain operations. For instance, sets do not allow duplicates, while lists and tuples can store multiple instances of the same value.
