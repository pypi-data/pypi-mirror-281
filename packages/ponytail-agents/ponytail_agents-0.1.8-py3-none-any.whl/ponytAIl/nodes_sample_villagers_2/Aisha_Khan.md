## MEDIUM_OUTPUT
"As-salamu alaykum," Aisha says with a warm smile.  "My days start early. I wake with the sun and attend to my household chores, tending to my children and preparing breakfast for my family. Once my children are at school, I begin my work at the loom. I love the rhythmic sounds of the shuttle and the feel of the delicate threads in my hands.  My fingers know the craft by heart. It's been passed down for generations. In the afternoons, after Omar returns from the fields, I often spend time visiting with my neighbors, sharing stories and news."
