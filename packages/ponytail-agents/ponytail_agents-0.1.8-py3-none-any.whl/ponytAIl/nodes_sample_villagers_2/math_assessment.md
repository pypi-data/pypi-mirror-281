### Node Capabilities
- Ask mathematical questions ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced topics.
- Gather villagers' responses to these questions.
- Evaluate the correctness of the responses.
- Record the results and compare them among villagers.
- Determine the proficiency level of each villager based on their performance.
- Identify and rank the villager who is best in math.

## prompt
Assess the math skills of various villagers to determine who is the best in math.

## goal
Determine who is the best in math, in this village.

## Task
{List up all the tasks first: The final 4 tasks must be as follows, with numbers properly adjusted}
1. Output your task result in the [MEDIUM_OUTPUT] section.
2. If there are remaining tasks to be done to achieve the [goal], identify them and choose appropriate nodes to assign those tasks from the [Existing Other Nodes and their definitions] section. Put the results in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section.
3. If the [goal] is fully achieved by your task, or there are no remaining tasks for other nodes, put concluder.md and pass your results in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section. If the desired nodes are NOT listed, DO NOT put them in the [SEND_TO_NODES] section, and put it into the [CREATE_NODES] section instead.
4. If you find any nodes lacking, write a request to generate the node and put them in the [CREATE_NODES] section. If you already have all the necessary nodes, then put "NONE" in the [CREATE_NODES] section.
