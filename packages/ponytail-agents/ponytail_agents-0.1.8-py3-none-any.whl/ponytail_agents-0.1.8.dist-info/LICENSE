# Modular and Inclusive Software Advancement License Classic (MISA-CLASSIC) v 1.5

## 1. Disclaimer of Liability

The creator(s) and/or copyright holder(s) of this product shall not be held liable or responsible for any obligations or liabilities arising from the use of this product.

## 2. Naming Continuity Obligation

Any derivative works or forks of this product, regardless of any additional licenses applied, must retain the name of the originating repository at the point of forking. This naming continuity obligation must be inherited by any subsequent forks or derivative works.

The retained name should be placed at the beginning of the derivative work's name. If any modifications are made to the name, the modified part should be clearly indicated after a hyphen ("-").

For example, if the originating repository's name was "AAA" at point A and "BBB" at point B:

- Forks created between point A and point B (exclusive) may use names such as "AAA", "AAA-plus", or "AAA-evolved".

  - Subsequent descendants of "AAA-plus" must continue to retain the "AAA" portion of the name.

- Forks created at or after point B must use names such as "BBB", "BBB-plus", or "BBB-rebooted".

- There is no retroactive renaming obligation (although voluntary updates are not prohibited). This means that forks created during the "AAA" period may continue to use the "AAA" name even after point B, as long as they retain the "AAA" portion of the name.

- Inheritance of the retained name should be based on the parent generation's retained portion, but tracing back to the origin is also permitted.

  - This means that descendants of "AAA-plus" created after point B may choose to revert to "BBB" for inheritance. However, as long as "AAA-plus" itself remains unchanged, inheriting from "AAA" is also acceptable.

## 3. Waiver of Other Copyrights

Except for any copyrights associated with the additional clauses or modifications described in Section 5 and onwards of this license, and the naming continuity obligation in Section 2, all other copyrights associated with this product are waived.

## 4. Modular Extensibility

### 4.1 License Name Continuity

The name of any derivative license must be based on the "MISA" name and maintain an equivalent naming continuity obligation as the MISA-CLASSIC license for its own derivatives.

### 4.2 Existing Clauses Immutability

The existing clauses of the MISA-CLASSIC license (Sections 1-4) cannot be modified. Any modifications or additions must be placed in separate sections (Section 5 onwards).

### 4.3 Modification Propagation

The modification and addition clauses (Section 5 onwards) can be further modified or extended by subsequent derivative licenses, as permitted by the terms of those clauses.

### 4.4 Addable Components

Derivative licenses may add any components that do not conflict with the existing clauses of the MISA-CLASSIC license. Some examples include, but are not limited to:

- Patent License: Grants users the rights to use any patents held by the contributor that are necessarily infringed by the usage of the software. Similar to the Apache License.

- Copyleft/Share-Alike: Requires derivative works to be licensed under the same or compatible terms. Akin to the GPL or CC BY-SA licenses.

- Source Code Disclosure: Mandates the distribution of source code along with the software. Found in the GPL.

- Attribution/Credit: Requires acknowledgement of the original creators. Present in the BSD, Apache, and CC BY licenses.

The addition of these components can bring the MISA-CLASSIC license closer in spirit to other well-known licenses.

By using this product, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license agreement.
