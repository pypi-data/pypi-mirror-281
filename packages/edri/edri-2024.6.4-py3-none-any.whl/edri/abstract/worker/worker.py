class Worker(Generic[T]):
    """
    A generic worker class designed to communicate with a manager through events. It supports sending and receiving messages,
    creating message streams for continuous communication, and handling the lifecycle of these streams.

    Attributes:
        _buffer (List[Event]): A buffer for storing received events that are not yet processed.
        _manager_pipe (Connection): The communication pipe to the manager.
        _name (str): The name of the worker, used for logging purposes.
        _stream_buffer (Optional[Event]): A buffer for the last received stream event.
        _stream_key (Optional[str]): The unique key identifying the current stream.
        event (EventType): The initial event associated with the worker.
        logger (Logger): Logger instance for logging messages.

    Methods:
        __init__: Initializes a new Worker instance.
        do: Abstract method defining the main logic of the worker; to be implemented by subclasses.
        message_send: Sends a message to the manager.
        message_receive: Receives a message from the manager, blocking if no message is available.
        run: Entry point for the worker's execution, wrapping the `do` method with error handling and cleanup.
        stream_close: Closes the current message stream.
        stream_create: Initiates a stream for sending and receiving messages of a specific type.
        stream_exists: Checks if a message stream currently exists.
        stream_poll: Checks if there are messages available in the stream.
        stream_receive: Receives a message from the stream.
        stream_send: Sends a message through the stream.
        stream_wait: Waits for a message in the stream, with an optional timeout.
