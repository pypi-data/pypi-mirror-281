  Parameters
  ----------
  x : array_like, Quantity
    Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
  axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
    Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed.
    The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical AND over all
    the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
    which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

    If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
    axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
  keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
    the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

    If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
    passed through to the `all` method of sub-classes of
    `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
    sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
    exceptions will be raised.
  where : array_like of bool, optional
    Elements to include in checking for all `True` values.

  Returns
  -------
  all : ndarray, bool
    A new boolean or array is returned unless `out` is specified,
    in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

  x, y : array_like, Quantity
    Logical OR is applied to the elements of `x` and `y`.
    If ``x.shape != y.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
  out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
  where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.

    For other keyword-only arguments, see the

  Returns
  -------
  out : ndarray or bool
    Boolean result of the logical OR operation applied to the elements
    of `x` and `y`; the shape is determined by broadcasting.
    This is a scalar if both `x` and `y` are scalars.
