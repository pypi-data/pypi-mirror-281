The files in this directory were all copied from:

https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger.git", rev = "v3.1.0"}

This is a temporary solution until ownership of python-json-logger on pypi is settled.
Until then, nhairs cannot push his fork to pypi.
If nhairs ultimately creates a different package on pypi,
I will delete this subdirecory and use his pypi package.
