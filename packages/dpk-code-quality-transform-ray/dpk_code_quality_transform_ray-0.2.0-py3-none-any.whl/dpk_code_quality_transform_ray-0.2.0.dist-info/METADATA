# Code Quality 

Please see the set of
[transform project conventions](../../../README.md)
for details on general project conventions, transform configuration,
testing and IDE set up.

## Summary
This project enables the [python malware transform](../python) to be run in a Ray runtime.
Please see the [python project](../python) for details on the transform implementation and use.

## Configuration and Command Line Options

Transform configuration options are the same as the base python transform.

## Running

### Launched Command Line Options
In addition to those available to the transform as defined in [here](../python/README.md),
the set of
[ray launcher](../../../../data-processing-lib/doc/ray-launcher-options.md) are available.

### Running the samples
To run the samples, use the following `make` targets

* `run-cli-ray-sample` - runs src/code_quality_transform.py using command line args
* `run-local-ray-sample` - runs src/code_quality_local_ray.py
* `run-s3-ray-sample` - runs src/code_quality_s3_ray.py
    * Requires prior installation of minio, depending on your platform (e.g., from [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/macos/index.html)
     and [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html) 
     and invocation of `make minio-start` to load data into local minio for S3 access.

These targets will activate the virtual environment and set up any configuration needed.
Use the `-n` option of `make` to see the detail of what is done to run the sample.

For example, 
```shell
make run-cli-sample
...
```
Then 
```shell
ls output
```
To see results of the transform.
