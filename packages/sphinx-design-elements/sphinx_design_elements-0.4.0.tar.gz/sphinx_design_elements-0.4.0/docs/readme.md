## About

A collection of composite and convenience web elements based on components
from [sphinx-design].


## Setup

Install the package using `pip install sphinx-design-elements`, and add the
extension to the list of `extensions` within your Sphinx configuration file
`conf.py`.

```python
extensions = [
    "sphinx_design",
    "sphinx_design_elements",
]
```

## Development

In order to learn how to set up a development sandbox, please visit the
[development documentation].


## Comparison to sphinx-design

[sphinx-design-elements] uses low-level components of [sphinx-design],
in order to build more high-level elements on top.


## Acknowledgements

Kudos to [Chris Sewell], [Chris Holdgraf], and all contributors for conceiving
and maintaining [MyST Parser] and [sphinx-design].
