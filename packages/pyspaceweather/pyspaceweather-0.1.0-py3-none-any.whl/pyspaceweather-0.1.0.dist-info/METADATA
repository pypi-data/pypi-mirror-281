# pyspaceweather

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/py-spaceweather/badge/?version=latest)](https://py-spaceweather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


`pyspaceweather` is a Python wrapper for the Australian Bureau of Metererology's [Space Weather API](https://sws-data.sws.bom.gov.au/).

The API provides access to near real-time data from the BOM's Australian Space Weather Forecasting Centre.

## Installation

```
pip install pyspaceweather
```

## Usage

An API key, which you can get from the [BOM](https://sws-data.sws.bom.gov.au/register), is required to use the API:

```python
import os

from pyspaceweather import SpaceWeather

sw = SpaceWeather(os.environ["SPACEWEATHER_API_KEY"])
```

Each [API request method](https://sws-data.sws.bom.gov.au/api-docs#overview) is available as a method of `SpaceWeather`.

For example, to get details of any magnetic alert current for the Australian region.

```python
alert_warnings = sw.get_mag_alert()
```

What's returned is a list of `MagAlert` objects:
```python
[MagAlert(start_time=datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 7, 8, 45),
valid_until=datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 7, 20, 45),
g_scale=1,
description='minor')
]
```

Or, to get historical A-index values, you can call `get_a_index()`, passing a string or `datetime` object to the relevant parameters:

```python
a_index_data = sw.get_a_index(start="2023-01-01 00:00:00", end=datetime(2023, 12, 1, 12, 30))
```

## Documentation

You can read documentation for this wrapper at [ReadTheDocs](https://py-spaceweather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
