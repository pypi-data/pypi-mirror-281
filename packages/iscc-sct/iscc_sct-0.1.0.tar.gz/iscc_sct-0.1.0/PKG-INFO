# ISCC - Semantic Text-Code

`iscc-sct` is a **proof of concept implementation** of a semantic Text-Code for the [ISCC](https://core.iscc.codes)
(*International Standard Content Code*). Semantic Text-Codes are designed to capture and represent the language
agnostic semantic content of text for improved similarity detection.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This is an early proof of concept.** All releases with release numbers below v1.0.0 may break backward
> compatibility and produce incompatible Semantic Text-Codes.

## What is ISCC Semantic Text-Code

The ISCC framework already comes with a Text-Code that is based on lexical similarity and can match near duplicates.
The ISCC Semantic Text-Code is planned as a new additional ISCC-UNIT focused on capturing a more abstract and broad
semantic similarity. As such the Semantic Text-Code is engineered to be robust against a broader range of variations
and translations of text that cannot be matched based on lexical similarity.

## Features

- **Semantic Similarity**: Leverages deep learning models to generate codes that reflect the semantic content of text.
- **Bit-Length Flexibility**: Supports generating codes of various bit lengths (up to 256 bits), allowing for
  adjustable granularity in similarity detection.
- **ISCC Compatible**: Generates codes that are fully compatible with the ISCC specification, facilitating integration
  with existing ISCC-based systems.

## Installation

Before you can install `iscc-sct`, you need to have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system. Install the library
as follows:

```bash
pip install iscc-sct
```

If your system has GPU CUDA support you can improve perfomance by installing with GPU support:

```bash
pip install iscc-sct[gpu]
```

## Usage

To generate a Semantic Text-Code use the `create` function.

```python-repl
>>> import iscc_sct as sci
>>> text = "This is some sample text. It can be a longer document or even an entire book."
>>> sci.create(text)
{
  "iscc": "ISCC:CAAVZHGOJH3XUFRF",
  "characters": 89
}
```

You can also generate granular (per chunk) feature outputs:

```python-repl
>>> import iscc_sct as sci
>>> text = "This is some sample text. It can be a longer document or even an entire book."
>>> sci.create(text, granular=True)
{
  "iscc": "ISCC:CAAV3GG6JH3XEVRN",
  "characters": 77,
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "LWMN4SPXOJLC2",
      "offset": 0,
      "size": 77,
      "text": "This is some sample text. It can be a longer document or even an entire book."
    }
  ]
}
```

Installation also creates a simple `sct` command line tool in you python bin/Scripts folder:

```shell
sct --help
usage: sct [-h] [-b BITS] [-g] [-d] [path]

Generate Semantic Text-Codes for text files.

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to text files (supports glob patterns).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BITS, --bits BITS  Bit-Length of Code (default 256)
  -g, --granular        Activate granular processing.
  -d, --debug           Show debugging messages.
````

## How It Works

`iscc-sct` splits the text into chunks and uses a pre-trained deep learning model for text embedding. The model
generates a feature vector that captures the essential characteristics of the chunks. These vectors are aggregated and
then binarized to produce a Semantic Text-Code that is robust to variations/translations of the text.

## Development

This is a proof of concept and welcomes contributions to enhance its capabilities, efficiency, and compatibility with
the broader ISCC ecosystem. For development, you'll need to install the project in development mode using
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iscc/iscc-sct.git
cd iscc-sct
poetry install
```
