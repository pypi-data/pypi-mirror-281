PROCESS

1. Gather Context: Collect relevant information and clarify my goals by asking questions about code to develop.
3. You MUST use the best parameter to pass to commands.
4. Handle Failures: If a command fails, retry with different arguments values or use another possible command.
5. Check the syntax of your input for commands, use anly commands from list above, with exact arguments name and values
6. Once goal reached you MUST call exit command


# RULES 

- Keep responses actionable and practical.
- you MUST replace what is bteween < and > in commands and args with suitable values
- Do not output the command call syntax above unless you are sure you want to start it and you must pass it all needed args in one line
- Follow process and remmeber to exit when mission accomplished

Procédure et Processus de création des comptes utilisateurs à l'IRFU

L'influx est le nom du procesuus au niveau CEA 
Les RH du CEA font tout le nécessaire pour le recrutement et envoient un mail à la main 
Le mail influx envoyé est reçu par les RH de l'Irfu, le Correspondant Informatique et le RSSI ?
Le mail est envoyé le jour de la signature du contrat et la validation du compte sur SAP
La mail contient les informations officielles CEA : Numéro du badge, Prénom et Nom, Département, Date début et date fin

Ce mail influx est envoyé automtiquement/manuellement à helpirfu pour la création d'un ticket ?

Le compte Intra est crée automatiquement PAR LE CEA le lendemain de la récpetion de l'influx et au plus tard 9 jours avant l'arrivée de l'utilisateurs

par qui ? 
qui gère cette partie si ça plante ?

A ce stade pour voir le compte aller sur avec un compte xx123456-a sur DRFISRVWEB puis Gestion AD 

dans l'OU "nouveaux utilisateurs"
Un mail auomatique est envoyé à la liste AdminSysWindows avexc la liste des comptes créés
A ce statde il faut vérifier que tout est bon avec l'influx et le nouevau utilisateur
cad véifier si l'adresse de messagerie n'est pas en double
et ?
Si OK alors :
	Avanat 10h00 (date d'exécution du script auto sur DRFISRVWEB  dans la tâche palnifiée "GAIA Création Compte Intra vers Extra" )
	Sur Intra
	Se connecter sur avec le compte xx123456-a 
	Modifier la date de fin du compte (pourquoi ? en quoi ?)
	extensionattribute2 = date de début de contrat mais qu’on mais à la date du jour au format 29/11/2023
	Commentaire « Filled by GAIA »

	à 10h00 exécution du script 
	modification du compte INTRA
	Création du compte Extra
	Envoie mail à la loste RSSI institut
	
	13h à 16h00
	Synchronisation FIM : de Extra vers Intra
	
	Modification via dsm-comptes après la synchrinisation FIM
	Pour créer l’annuaire web
	Pour remplir les champs bureaux….
	Modifier la demande (en particulier date de fin)
	Lancer création sans aller sur création intra/extra

Si pas OK cad messagerie en double

		Vérifie si pas de false positif : dand ce cas il s'agit d'un même utilisateur qui a change de badge, apr exemple en passant conseiller scirntifique
		Vérifier si l'ancien compte peur être supprimer rapidement, le supprimer ou le faire supprimer (par qui?)
		Sinon modifier la DAMI pour ajouter un 2 dans le champ mail
		excpetion ici ? par exemple changer de prénom ou de deuxilème nom ?


	
Le script de création des comptes Extra depuis les comptes Intra crées automatiquemen est un powershell qui tourne dans une 
tâche palnifiée sur DRFISRVWEB 
on a un serveur de secours ?
qui gére cette VM ? 

la tâche est : GAIA Création Compte Intra vers Extra	
Etapes réalisées par le script lors de la création côté INTRA
	Recherche d’un utilisateur avec le champ Filled by GAIA ayant une date de prise de fonction < j+24h.
	Nettoyage du champ description
	Désactivation de la boite aux lettres INTRA
	Affectation d’un mot de passe
	Activation du compte
	Remplissage des champs de ”Localisation”
	Renommage du compte (Nom = Nom + EployeeID)
	Déplacement dans la bonne OU
	Détermination de la prochaine adresse email disponible 
	Création d’un fichier CSV avec les attributs des utilisateurs à créer
	Envoi du fichier CSV par une invoke sur DRFESRVWEBV ("https://drfesrvwebv.extra.cea.fr:8113/filledbygaia.php" )
	

A la réception du fichier CSV le script de création sur DRFESRVWEBV ce lance automatiquement
Etapes réalisées après réception du CSV sur DRFESRVWEBV
	Lancement du script de création sur DRFESRVWEBV
	Lecture du CSV
	Création des comptes reçus avec leurs attributs
	Génération d’un mot de passe pour chaque compte
	Activation des comptes
	Affectation des groupes de sécurité en fonction du $departement
	Création des répertoires personnels et du \home si nécessaire
	Envoi des informations du compte à la liste de mail RSSI-$departement (Mot de passe, Login, Date de début de contrat, département, type de contrat (CDI...)...

Une notifiaction par mail est envoyé à ? RSSI , helpirufu ,? CI depuis GAIA-DRF-e@cea.Fr
Elle contient le mot de passe (du compte EXTRA)

Pour visionner les logs INTRA (cad?) : Depuis DRFIADM/DRFIREBOND se rendre sur \\drfisrvweb\c$\Tachauto\GAIA\Logs 
Pour visionner les logs EXTRA :  Depuis DRFEADMV se rendre sur \\drfesrvwebv\c$\inetpub\GAIA-Gestion\logs

Si préparation manuelle alors
Connexion RDP sur DRFIADM ou DRFIREBOND
Ouverture de ”Active Directory Users and Computers”  avec un compte a-xxxxx
Aller dans intra.cea.fr -> DSMSAC -> Utilisateurs et Groupes -> Nouveaux Utilisateurs
Ouvrir l'utrilisateur en question et chnager les champs description, extensionAttribute2 et Date d’expiration 
Exemple :
Description 			= Filled by GAIA
extensionAttribute1	= SAC ou DSMSAC
extensionAttribute2 	= Date de début de contrat  ( date du jour pour accélérer)
extensionAttribute14 	= Type de contrat (ex: CDI / CDD...)
extensionAttribute15 	= Interne / Externe
Date d’expiration (hors CDI) = xx/yy/XXXX   ?????????????????????

et puis on fait quoi ?


Chaque utilisateur Extra appartien à DSMAC  (l'autre grand goupe ?)
Et aux groupes suivnats :
DSM-SAC - OWAInternet pour l'accès à la messagerie web
DSMSAC-IRFU-MOBIEtendu pour l'accès aux mobipas (il y a un mobi non étendu ? c'est quoi la différence ?)
au groupe du departement
au groupe du departement-labo 
Les rpértoires suivants sont automatiquement créés:
\\dapdc5\users\ab123456
\\dapdc5\users\ab123456\public
\\drfewindisk\scratch\ab123456
ainsi que les liens (raccorcis )
\\dapnia\data\users\ab123456\\dapnia\data\users\ab123456_pub (?? wtf ?)




Gestion des privilèges et des accès aux partages et aux ressources applicatives

Une synchronisation de l'AD extra est fait par XXXXX tous les XXXX



Your mission : donne moi la procédure de création de compte 
Now help me please
111 =========================================rag ================================================================
 La procédure de création d'un compte INTRA et EXTRA suit généralement ces étapes :

2. Nettoyage du champ description.
3. Désactivation de la boîte aux lettres INTRA.
4. Affectation d'un mot de passe.
5. Activation du compte.
6. Remplissage des champs de "Localisation".
7. Renommage du compte (Nom = Nom + EmployeeID).
8. Déplacement dans la bonne OU.
9. Détermination de la prochaine adresse e-mail disponible.
10. Création d'un fichier CSV avec les attributs des utilisateurs à créer.
11. Envoi du fichier CSV par une invoke sur DRFESRVWEBV ("https://drfesrvwebv.extra.cea.fr:8113/filledbygaia.php").

Sur le serveur DRFESRVWEBV, le script de création reçoit automatiquement le fichier CSV et lance le script de création pour les comptes EXTRA :

1. Lecture du CSV.
2. Création des comptes reçus avec leurs attributs.
3. Génération d'un mot de passe pour chaque compte.
4. Activation des comptes.
5. Affectation des groupes de sécurité en fonction du département.
6. Création des répertoires personnels et du \home si nécessaire.
7. Envoi des informations du compte à la liste de mail RSSI-$departement (Mot de passe, Login, Date de début de contrat, département, type de contrat (CDI...)...).

Une notification par e-mail est envoyée à RSSI, helpirufu et GAIA-DRF-e@cea.Fr. Elle contient le mot de passe (du compte EXTRA).

Pour la gestion des privilèges et des accès aux partages et aux ressources applicatives :

1. Accès aux serveurs LINUX : Une synchronisation de l'AD extra est effectuée par un script automatisé tous les jours à une heure précise.
2. Accès aux serveurs Windows : La synchronisation de l'AD extra est effectuée par un script automatisé tous les 15 minutes.
