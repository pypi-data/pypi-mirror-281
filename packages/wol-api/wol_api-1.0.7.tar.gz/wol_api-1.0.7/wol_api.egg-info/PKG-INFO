A simple http interface to send wake on LAN commands.

Just send a
- `GET` to `/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` 
- `POST` to `/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` 
- `GET` to `/wol/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` 
- `POST` to `/wol/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` 

where `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` is the desired MAC address of the device to be woken up.

# Setup

`pip install wol_api`

# Run

` wol_api --port=8080`

# Docker
```
docker run -d \
  --name="WakeOnLAN-API" \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  --network host \
  rix1337/docker-wol-api:latest
  ```

The desired port is set by environment variable `PORT` for a reason!
You must use `--network host`, else the magic packets will not be sent to the correct network.
