    Parameters
    ----------
    wms_service : `str`
        Name of the class.
    run_id : `str`
        A run id the report will be restricted to.
    user : `str`
        A username the report will be restricted to.
    hist_days : int
        Number of days.
    pass_thru : `str`
        A string to pass directly to the WMS service class.
    is_global : `bool`, optional
        If set, all available job queues will be queried for job information.
        Defaults to False which means that only a local job queue will be
        queried for information.

        Only applicable in the context of a WMS using distributed job queues
        (e.g., HTCondor).
    return_exit_codes : `bool`, optional
        If set, return exit codes related to jobs with a
        non-success status. Defaults to False, which means that only
        the summary state is returned.

        Only applicable in the context of a WMS with associated
        handlers to return exit codes from jobs.
